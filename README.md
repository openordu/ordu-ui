This is the Open Ordú Project's Frontend git repository.

Our project's purpose is to produce a free software toolkit and text-base for a making a high-quality accessible website. The project's goals include producing a reliable set of source texts, guides or praxis, and licensing it in a way enabling personalization and customization of the text for local rites and customs and conveying ownership of the changed format to the creator who licenses those changes back to the community at large.

Toward this goal, we are creating a collaborative space as a platform built on a community of individuals passionate about Celtic Paganism. We are inpsired by [Open Siddur](github.com/opensiddur/opensiddur) which enables people in the Jewish community "to craft their own siddur, ... to use it as an educational tool, or for sharing prayers, translations, commentaries, art, and layout templates for new siddurim." Likewise Open Ordú will allow us to bring Celtic paganism and the culture which surrounds it into a version control system for sharing, education, commentary, and development of the culture itself. This culture cannot be appropriated as it is open to everyone, the arbiters of this culture are the contributors of its development, taking mixed cloth pieces of our heritage and creating a new whole cloth heritage that cannot be forgotten because it is in git.

This mission is done with care and will encompass the values of pluralism (acceptance for the diversity of Celtic cultural expression), historical awareness, and individual soverienghty.

The technical portions of the project form three major parts:

1. Source Texts: myths, stories, customs, prayers, praxis, charms, healing, rites, songs, dances, poety
1. Frontend: A body of UI which turns the Markdown into a website.
1. Public Celtic Encyclopedia: A whack at a public form of [Mary Jone's JCE](maryjones.us/jce)

Volunteer coders are always welcome. We are, in particular, looking for vuejs and vuepress user interface programmers.

This site serves as the project's code repository, code documentation, and issue tracker.

Comments and bug reports from anyone are welcome.
