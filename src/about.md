## What is this Project?

This is a project called the **_[OpenordúProject](https://www.github.com/openordu/)_** 
which features a **_[Public Celtic Encyclopedia(PCE)](https://www.github.com/openordu/pce)_**.

It exists as a resource guide supporting the practice of Celtic Paganism. This
project is released under the [Celtic Culture Attribution Share Alike 4.0
International](license.md).

## About this project
Our project's purpose is to produce a free software toolkit and text-base for a
making a high-quality hyper-accessible website. The project's goals include
producing a reliable set of source texts, guides and praxis, licensing it in a
way enabling personalization and customization of the text for local rites and
licenses those changes back to the community at large.

Toward this goal, we are creating a collaborative space as a platform built on a
community of individuals passionate about Celtic Paganism. We are inspired by
[Open Siddur](http://opensiddur.org) which enables people in the Jewish
community "to craft their own siddur, ...to use it as an educational tool, or
for sharing prayers, translations, commentaries, art, and layout templates for
new siddurim."

Likewise Openordú will allow us to bring Celtic paganism and the culture which
surrounds it into a version control system for sharing, education, commentary,
and development of the culture itself. This culture cannot be appropriated as it
is open to everyone, the arbiters of this culture are the contributors of its
development, taking mixed cloth pieces of our heritage and creating a new whole
cloth heritage belongs to those who honor it.

This mission is done with care and will encompass the values of pluralism
(acceptance for the diversity of Celtic cultural expression), historical
awareness, and individual sovereignty.

The technical portions of the project form three major parts:

Source Texts: myths, stories, customs, prayers, praxis, charms, healing, rites,
songs, dances, poetry Frontend: A body of UI which turns the Markdown into a
website. Public Celtic Encyclopedia: A whack at a public form of Mary Jones's
JCE Volunteer coders are always welcome. We are, in particular, looking for
vuejs and vuepress user interface programmers.

This site serves as the project's code repository, code documentation, and issue
tracker.

Comments and bug reports from anyone are welcome.

## Why isn't Wikipedia Good?

Often it is good. But when we add to it, our changes get reverted by bots. There
is a long process to get changes approved and this takes up more time than we
have. We simply want to write what we know and grow it. Wikipedia also doesn't
stand to support Celtic Paganism(CP), though it has played an important role in
educating newbies, this site is CP facing.

## What About Mary

[AKA Mary Jones](http://maryjones.us) is one of the greatest resources for
Celtic pagans. We have permission from Mary to [contribute](/docs/contribute/ )
her work here. Some of the pronunciations and translations are off, and articles
are now outdated. This is a way to remedy that and for that work to live on as
the [PCE](/public-celtic-encyclopedia/).

## Praxis focused
The number one complaint from new Celtic pagan is that they don't know what to
do. Book give worldview and belief systems from which people put together their
own set.... but they still lack on praxis and what to do. We want our project to
be a what-to-do first, learning why, how, and what for later. This models how
humans learn culture on their own. They're doing way sooner than they're
understanding why. It's the doing that contextualizes the why for newbies.
