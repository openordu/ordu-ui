# An Open Letter to Celtic Pagans
Many folks know I've been a clergy postulant with ADF for a while and an
 official member since 2003. I've led groves in Austin and Houston, and helped
 contribute to others elsewhere, published blogs, both druidic and on general
 mysticism. I've waged many a pagan argument and usually stand my ground with
 the best of them, though I've made many more missteps to get there.

In 2015 I had a series(seven) of mystical experiences trying to recreate the
 vedic prophecy-potion Soma. "We drank soma, we became immortal, we came to the
 light, we found gods."[^first] It has taken me nearly seven years to get all of
 me back into this world. And so I've been stolen away to fairy and initiated
 into a preisthood by a Fairy Queen who put me through an agonizing tribunal
 where I had a vision of her pulling out my bowels and putting them back in
 after cleaning them. Later I've found bits of what happened to me stowed away
 in folklore. For instance, A man named ‘An’ is visited by a 'nightmare' figure
 who stabs him in the stomach and pulls out his entrails. He lies dead having a
 second dream or vision that she is putting his entrails back in[^second].
 
Having had this same vision as a man who lived more than twice seven centuries
 ago, I count it as one of my lived experiences that is seared into 

Needless to say, I feel qualified and confidend in writing this letter.

## The Problem

I have studied Neodruidism, the Celtic Reconstructionist Methodology and its
 subsequent religions, druidcraft(drycraeft), medeival witchcraft and folk
 magic, and more. I found my home with [ADF](http://www.adf.org) for a while but
 I feel differntly now. ADF prepared me to an extent, but it was the work and
 time of reconstructionists which help shaped me.

I keep going back to Animism as a foundation of Polytheism as is apparent in the
 studies of Nurit Bird-David, Durkheim, Guthrie, and Strathern. There existed an
 animistic polytheism which still demonstrates itself in the expressions of
 scholars in medieval tradition and colloquial expression.

I keep going back to the prevalent attitude among people that druid ritual and
 practice has nothing to do with folk magic even through one of its names is
 dreecraft after draoi. So in ADF you've got plenty of people calling themseves
 druids who don't like druidry(magic). If they're not into draiocht, then why is
 it in their name?

I've invested in this idea of a high liturgy within polytheist practice as
 potentially recognizable by my ancestors. I still believe it, but I think it
 has been executed in the most bland and not very Celtic way. I long for hearth
 rites and hill rites that recognize what is going on in folklore.

## The Solution

Jane E. Harrison, a Greek Scholar, says **myth is what is '_said_' while ritual
 is what is '_done_'**, and [Cat Heath](https://seohelrune.com/) describes on
 her facebook account heathen spell-workings that involve doing a charm act
 while saying a folk-tale from which the magician has drawn an analogy directly
 to the outcome. Good spell outcomes are likened to the object won in myth, like
 Indra capturing Soma from the Ashuras, or releasing the rains after slaying
 Vtra. On either side of that is the act of you re-enacting the myth and
 reciting the myth.

So this sense of a ritual order, the core of ADF's identity, that involves
 actions and invocations, and poetry and sometimes music, that opens, offers,
 blesses, and closes just doesn't work for me the way I've been doing it
 anymore. I need something closer to what the Mari in Russia have, what the
 Indian Nayakan have, and what the ancestors who worshiped our gods probably
 had.

I need a rite that consists of a dismemberment of primordial sacrifice and the
 magico-alchemical preparation of that into a blessing mostly in metered charm
 and sometimes unmetered charm. That is specifically a different thing than what
 ADF presents as its identity.

## More of the Problem

Episcopagan is a term for pagans with no ritual ecstasis, and I have never done
 ritual outside a state of induced ecstasy. I'm very tired of Episcopaganism. I
 want my paganism to be a song on a spear.
 
The members of ADF have no interest in ritual reformation, they have no interest
 in dropping questionable things like the "Norse Wheel of the Year". When I read
 the founder's original open letter, I wonder why ADF has completely missed the
 mark on some of these things. ADF has not done well making a family of
 Indo-European paganisms, that experiment has failed. Instead they have created
 a culture-specific adverse pan-IE mush.

While at an ADF corporate meeting, I witnessed a man asking me to de-emphasise
 magic because not all members believe in magic when I refered to Draoicht as
 magic, however, it is precisley the meaning of the word in its native language,
 in which ADF is named "Our Own Magic". This isn't representative of the whole
 to not believe in magic, however, ADF as a whole only focuses on theurgy.
 However, we can't find a theurgical v thaumaturgical distinction among the
 remnant pagan practices that prevade the medeival period. This habitual
 attitude to see druidry as having nothing whatever to do with Indo-European
 'low' magic, nor having an interest to investigate its commonalities, is
 precisly what scratches on me like nails on chalkboard. I asked a former
 Archdruid about some of this and was encouraged to start a super niche subgroup
 about it.

ADF has seemed to be now, slower than an oak in reconstructing the best view of
what Paleopagans speaking a Celtic or Indo-European Language actually did. In
1983 The Org set out to publish a journal on par with academic journals worth a
value of $279 per year in todays money.

This Journal was the Druid's Progress that eventually became Oak Leaves. I
 regard Oak Leaves as hardly worth the money I pay for it. I used to open it
 with excitement many years ago. This is not the fault of the production team or
 its contributors but rather the design of the Org as able to produce a journal
 for the cost charged. Originally selling for $20, it would be sold for $55
 dollars in today's money. I think this is a result of pagans thinking
 non-profit means no-gains and non-proslyletizing as no marketing. Never was
 there a religion that wasn't marketed. Since you're already dabbling in
 marketing if you're not willing to do it well and for a noble purpose, your org
 that you refuse to think about like a business will die. Druids are functions
 of tribes, tribes have tributes, tax, and an economy, even when subjegated by
 another kingdom.

## More of the Solution

What can we do? Well I don't think you can repair something this broken, you
 have to replace it. That's a lot of work that we have to be sure we are ready
 for before we set out to do it. With my track record of devoted time to my craft
 and public paganism, I don't see what else I would do. Being open-sourced, the
 site that displays this cultural project, can be moved by people within either
 the open-source community who edits it or the spiritual communities that form
 around it. We'll create a non-profit Organization, produce study open-sourced
 materials, guides, a public Celtic encyclopedia all free as in free beer and
 free as in freedom to use, modify, grow and claim.
 
Thanks to the research of the Rees Brothers, the people who produce Duchas.ie,
James MacKillop, John T. Koch, John Carey, Barry Cunliffe, Patricia Monaghan,
Danaher and Dáithí Ó hÓgáin, all the true folklorists of the Celtic Revivalist
Period and Indo-European comparative scholars, we can just go about giving it a
good old try at knowing what was done and why it was done.

Since about 1983, ADF was the first major group trying to reconstruct what the
 paleopagan Indo-Europeans believed and fill in holes from that reconstruction
 where something was missing as a genuine 'religion' and by a 'church'. That
 methodology has only become more accepted overtime and has even been highly
 useful to understanding paganism in general. 
 
I've read so many books on this topic that I can recognize where comparativism
 has saturated every corner of folklore enabling those who oppose it also
 unwittingly rely on it, a fact I find quite amusing.
 
While some accept the work of Georges Dumezil, other's find it not useful. Yet
 no one has refuted every shred of evidence one by one. It cannot be done. The
 only recourse opponents can take is to show the universality of the three
 functions among cow herders around the world. I personally don't care that
 trifunctionality is uniquley Indo-European or not. If it is common to all
 pastoral herdsmen, fine.
 
Those who profess the theory's lake of usefulness are not in the business of
 creating new pagan structures where only christian ones survived. For me, the
 theory been made seemingly impossible tasks effortless. Therefore we will use
 it despite Dumezil's early involvement with fascism. We are fully anti-fascist,
 anti-bigotry. But we treat works like everything else and divorce insighful
 things from the bigots or abusers who created them. A full analysis of his
 theory will follow eventually with a focus on analysis for fascist ideals being
 put into the theory.

## Purpose

The purpose of this letter is to announce the creation of this Org as a new clan
 in the spiritual vein of the old Déis or Déisi.

Originally a 3rd century artifical clanless designation for vassals and farmers,
 déisi groups with artifically made lore of a lineage from kings eventually
 became a few real clans with real political power. Due to their close
 interactions, common expulsions, or belief in a lore-ideology, déisi groups
 became several real tribes, including the clan to which I belong, clan Ó Dea
 from Ó Deághaidh(grandchild of good luck). 'Godwin' didn't otherwise appear in
 Brittain until much later after the battle of Hastings so it is thought to be a
 form Irish Ó Dea people took on when they went into English speaking areas. The
 Ó Dea's and Godwin's I know who are pagan claim descendancy from the Good God,
 the Dagdae.
 
 The Déisi also moved into Wales and Britain between 300 and 450 C.E making two
 things apparent to us:
 
 1. They were the original Irish diasporans but in the fourth century.
 1. Time forges fake clans into real ones.

Greece was divided into artificial tribes that by close proximity become real
 when they switched to a Demogratic government, making them something we can
 reconstruct.

Clan Ó Déa claims to be a sept of Dál gCais(Dalcassians) who claims to be
 founded by the King of Thomond(Co Clare), Cormac(Tál) Cas, son of Conall of the
 Swift Steeds. Yet, modern scholarship has them descending from the Déisi Muman
 of Munster. Regardless, the Dál gCais branched off into a great number of
 lineages:

O'Curry, O'Cormacan, O'Seasnain, O'Brennan, Glinn, Magan, Muldowney, O'Hurley,
 MacNamara, Harley, Stoney, Hickey, O'Hay, Clancy, Flattery, O'Grady, Tubridy,
 Hartigan, Durkin, Killeen, Hogg, O'Dea, O'Quin, MacBrody, O'Heffernan, Kielty,
 Perkin, O'Meara, Scanlan, MacArthur, Cosgrave, O'Hogan, Lonergan, O'Brien,
 MacMahon, MacConsidine, MacLysaght, O'Crotty, Eustace, O'Kennedy, O'Reagan,
 O'Kelleher, Boland, O'Casey, Power, Twomey, Ahearne, Magrath, Plenty More.

You do not have to be part of one of these clans to join us. Membership within
 our clan is not dependent on coming from a Celtic background. We believe that
 stay-in-your-own-lane religions always lead to the increase in racism. What we
 do is for everyone who loves it. Your love for it is born of our Béan Sí and
 somehow it left her and entered you, making you our kin.

# Name

In Irish and Scottish we'll be known as the Ó Déisi, Mac Déisi or the Déiseanna,
 in Welsh we'll be called the Ap Deiliad, In Gaulsih language we can be refered
 to as Dala. Déis is cognate with Proto-Brythonic *dalg-, from
 Proto-Indo-European *delgʰ-. Cognate with Latin indulgeo. Proto-Brythonic
 *dalg- from Proto-Indo-European *delgʰ- means to split, divide, cut, carve and
 the English word tiller descends from it making our clan predominantly a
 working class peoples. It's fitting that the words we'll use to define
 ourselves are made of the stuff of defining. We will certainly carve out our
 own place in the cosmos.

We will practice the same core familial religion in every Celtic language that
 we have septs in. It will not be considered a pan-Celtic religion but a
 core-Celtic religion wide-sweeping variations among cultural subgroups, and
 more localized variations in every house-hold.

## Ancestors

Using the term Déisi invokes the third century groups as well as the twelth
 century ones as our ancestors. We can claim descendency from *Dyeus who tills
 with this weapon, we see that god in Sucellos, Taranis, and Dago Deiwos(the
 Dagda). He is our first ancestor, our Béan Sí is the local land goddess in
 Clare Anand/Anu in Cailleach form resides in Cahercalla(fort of the Hag). The
 Déisi are expected to pilgrimage to this fort at least once in their lives.

Our tuatha or pobal will be group of any individuals from any backgroun who
 share an affinity with things Celtic. We will research the animist sense of
 personhood and community and don those for ourselves opting to re-indigenize
 ourselves. Not making us native to where we are as a diaspora, but rather
 returning to the view that we belong to the land, that she is our mother.

Additionally we also have a foster Béan Sí who is the land goddess upon which we
 now dwell.

I've already started this project and have begun an open-source project called
 the Public Celtic Encyclopedia as well as a license which can apply to any
 cultural works we produce for intra-clan use. I will not be able to complete it
 alone and I can only script it to copy wikipedia articles and make a list of
 those to rewrite. This is better than nothing I feel for a start though this is
 not the long term strategy which is to purposefully research and write every
 single topic.

We aim to include everything in the encyclopdea: history, polytheology, liturgy,
 legal structures, art and music, calendars and customs. We'll organize it in
 ways that will be intuitive for folks looking for everything related to this
 and this time or for such and such event.

This is where I need you. I need to build a fullfilling, accurate, culturally
 responsible, whole cloth, and complete system. So I'm going to need
 contributors and feedback from those who plan to invest in membership when the
 time is read.

Now Celtic Paganism is not for everyone, so an initial large response is not
 expected, required, or desired. However, we will welcome whatever response we
 get as we've asked for everyone who wants to join to consider it.

If you're interested, 

Please consider filling out the interest form here and we'll figure out a way to
keep you apprised of this Ó Déisi druid's progress.

With a little bit of luck, the blessings of the Gods and a great deal of hard
 work, we can create an artificial clan who practices a religion our ancestors
 would be proud of and recognize.

Béal o na nDeithe ort... Blessings of the Gods on you!
