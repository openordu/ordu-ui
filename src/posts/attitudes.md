## pan-practices
## there are areas where you don't belong
## you can do the rites but they aren't empowered unless you have the teachings
## religion changes on large time scales, core tenets of IE paganism are 1000s of years old, not days
## taking what's sacred and making it profane
## selling classes is hucksterism
## proslyetizing is the mark of a charlatan, genuinely spiritual people don't do it.
## American Indians ask us to got back to our own ways instead of adopt theirs
## New aged stuff makes people feel good, but healing happens where it hurts
   
   note: "Is a spiritual vacuum that this society we live in, it creates
   people that are looking for something that is real. - Dennis Jennings[^jennings]
