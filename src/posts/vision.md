# Vision

## Project Mission
CelticPaganism.org exists to empower users to access and create their own
 resources from a store of common works, records of discourse, and important
 canonical texts and associated translations and metadata.

I want this website to be be a creation in the early-tradition of [Open-Source
 Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_religion) within the
 context of Celtic Paganism, Celtic Reconstructionism, Celtic
 Post-reconstructionism, and Neodruidism.

Open-Source software are user-generated content that is licensed so that anyone
 can see the code, fork the code, perform a fix in the fork, and then have it
 reviewed and pulled into the mainline. Open-Source software is often also Free
 Software. Free software is software that can be reused by others whether with a
 General license or none at all.

Licensing your religious practices inherits all the precedences of agreements of
 Software Licensing. Software are sets of instructions like religious practices,
 and Open-Source software is licensed with a no-gaurentees attitude.

Open-Source religion has a few contexts:
* Religious software like [Open
 Siddir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Siddur_Project)
* Repositories of common works, records of discourse, and important texts like
   [Witchcraft Information Centre and
   Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20180422043802/http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php)
  * Regarded as the first open-source paganism, founded in 1999 as a research
   and education provider specialising in the areas of Witchcraft, Wicca,
   Paganism, Magic
  * This is the contexts that [celticpaganism.org](celticpaganism.org) operates
    within.

The contents of this website will exist for the free use of anyone with
 attribution under a license we will create and maintain.


## Project Vision
I see a chalenging world where paganism is a primary coping mechanism for power
 struggles in the lives of those individuals that are severly impacted by
 climate change mass migrations, rising sea levels, and a changing digital
 economy. Some of us going to space, some of us going to the realms of the gods
 through folds in between moments. Some of us going into seed arks underground.

Whatever form humanity takes, this project can fit on small drives, be freely
  contributed to, forked and distributed. Wherever people go, whatever people
  do, this text can follow it, it can be archived by robots, multiplied and
  buried in 1000 data centers. People in the future may not be able to read it,
  but they will if we translate this into enough languagues.

Reconstructionist and post-Recon Paganism is worthless if people have to keep
 reconstructing the same things from now worn and fading out-of-print books.
 We've made really solid assesments arguing about the same things thousands of
 times, and some of those ideas can be lost if not perserved. So there needs to
 be a place where that stuff can be put and stored.
 
We've failed for the most part to create institutions with the likenesses of
 Druid Colleges. We've failed at creating oral traditions that we pass down. Our
 current culture doesn't even resemble one that can train our brains to be an
 oral culture. We are a text culture. And so we have to do something different.
 This is not an imperitive to anyone, pass on by if you're bah-humbugin' it.
 
This'll be a menu. A menu of customs, rites, songs, prose, poetry, and more. If
 I end up being only a fool with a vision, and the only contributor to a never
 released project, marked in front of everyone as someone who doesn't finish...
 I've been worse things, so lets do it.

I want to create a community-contributed resource guide that is as every bit as
 good as [Mary Jones' website](http://maryjones.us), and that anyone with good
 ideas can contribute to. I envision the real idea of open-source religion and
 so I am creating a git project.

Anyone off of the street will be able to branch off the entire website you see
 here, make changes, and propose code reviews to a group of people for
 discussion. The use of and learning curve around git provides enough of a
 barrier to keep out unwanted people: racists, people who like survive the jive,
 credulous people, and folks with tenious ideas.

Still some whacky people will get through and that's why we can have some kind
 of senisble tenioring of contibutors with tierd approvals. Changes will have to
 garner indiference or pleasure from all the approver of these merge/pull
 requests of custom branches back into the mainline.

I've had this vision irritating me, just gnawing at me for over a decade. It is
 tied to my agreements with the gods, I consider it a devotional act. I can do
 my best, but that will by no means beat the wisdom of the crowd.

I see this an academic quality publication that is highly suggestive of
practice. ADF has a liturgists guild that one time produced rituals. We don't
need such a guild to rite rituals, but you'd never see neopagan rites appear in
celtic studies sections of the library. So this is certainly a site that serves
the purpose OBOD or ADF's sites server for them, but for any organization.
Though sponsored someone could make a copy of our PCE and ctext and create their
own Guides.

## Isn't that what Wikipedia is?
The arbiters of information on [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) will often
 revert changes made by well-known scholars of Celtic Paganism for several
 stupid reasons. The idea of Wikipedia is great and superior, but Wiki-Lords now
 stifle honest contributions. We are highly trained specialists with well
 exposed arguements in the most critical of pagan communities. It's our duty to
 put all that down into words, then make guides through the landscapes of those
 words.

## Moving Away from Institutions as Lore-Repositories
We will create a site that serves much like ADF's public and members site does
 for its members. This site can be as such but non-denominationally like
 [maryjones.us](http://maryjones.us) is for Celtic Reconstructionists.

This fixes several things if you can imagine:
1. Engaging with this canonical repository requires no payment or submission to
 a central organization.
1. Organizations can be kept by lore rather than lore kept by organizations.
1. The rise and fall of organizations does not affect this code because this
 code isn't owned, it licenses itself.
1. When an organization dies, even the one that maintains this version of this
 lore, the lore can be picked back up from archive later, and then made into a
 new site.
1. Instead of speady as an oak, we can be as speedy as a song on a spear.
1. Things can be fixed quickly when an update to the known world occurs.
1. In a git repository, even through millions and millions of changes, even
 minute ones, the complete history of the evolution of a lore is recorded.
 People can investigate trends in the ideas of the maintainers of the lore and
 protect themselves from religious revisionists. It's hard to deface every
 iteration of every change in a git repository as long as that repository
 exists.

## What more can we do than Wikipedia ever could
Stakeholders can be approvers of content. The more approvers there are, the more
 diverse and representative of wild nature our ideas will be. Wikipedia is ruled
 by information Barons often leaning too hard on tenuous ideas and not enough on
 solid ones.

With [Basic](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/),
[Extended](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/), and [Theme Specific
 Markdown](/docs/editing/) we have more features than Wikipedia.

Wikipedia isn't organized to collect customs, traditions, rites, or songs toward
 promoting the practice of paganism.

## Who the heck is we?
Right now, it only me. But it includes anyone who can propose changes that are
 sound. I will form a specific priesthood and organization around this
 eventually. Just like Oracle owns Mysql, yet MySQL is free and open-source
 software(FOSS)â€”[celticpaganism.org](celticpaganism.org) is owned by whatever
 organization forms around it. This is personal property under licesense until I
 grant it to that future organization.

## Licensing
We're cloning the [Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0
 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), taking out the line
 requiring you to inidcate modifications you've made and forbidding you to
 change any author tags, forcing you to preserve a lineage of ideas. We're
 trying to create a license for cultural works, and culture does not operate in
 a way where everytime anyone has changed the world it is apparent to you.
 This'll be called the [Celtic Culture Attribution-ShareAlike 1.0 International
 Public License](/license).

Usually, this line protects the reputation of the original org, so that
 incorrect changes are labeled and so blame can be placed with the correct
 party. But I think if someone takes this text, and puts it on their site, makes
 incorrect adjustments to it, we'll be better off than we are now with those
 folk plagerizing said text and defacing it anyways. Any versions of this text
 that is truely developed and not ripped off and defaced can and should be
 contributed back to the original project. Our licensing forbids anyone using
 this to relicense it against us or anyone else. Everything contributed here
 belongs to everyone with atribution.

::: tip TLDR You can use this text in almost any way provided that you:
1. You _**must**_ give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, but do
   not have to indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable
   manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor(us) endorses you or
   your use.
2. ShareAlike - If you remix, transform, or build upon this material, you
   _**must**_ distribute your contributions under the same License as the
   original.
3. The license obviously doesn't apply to works it can't apply to, like if you
   contributed someone elses copywriten work to the project, like a small quote,
   the quote obvsiously doesn't belong to the project. :::

## Organization
There will be an organization which folks can join that forms around this
 project. It will center around a priesthood who tend to the needs households or
 groups of households have for them. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this org will be to educate people about various cultures that
 are called Celtic, and the native religous practices surrounding those cultures
 and their diaspora.
### Study
Unlike ADF this org will not produce a study "program" but rather study
 "material". We will use this project to write the actual training material
 rather than an outline of essay topics written from "material". We will seek to
 address every single question a seeker has in one form or another with an
 scholastic excellence boasted about by other druid orgs.

This study material will then be able to have a school or schools formed around
it.

### Subgroups
ADF has an overkill on subgroups. We're going have cultural subgroups called
kinships and role subgroups called colleges.

The cultural subgroups will be:
* Irish
* Scottish
* Welsh
* Manx
* Gaulish
* Bretton
* A Syncratic culture involving at least one of the above.
* Any specific ethnoliguistic group that I've forgoten.

The role subgroups will be:
* Druids
* Seers
* Bards
* Cunning Folk
* Layfolk

No sigs, no orders, no guilds.

Each subgroup will seek to maintain their own guide in the [guides](/guides)
 section. They will strive to make it complete and comprehensive, well formatted
 and well organized.

::: warning Contributors We have need for these types of contributors at the
beginning stages:
1. Researchers
1. Writers
1. Proof readers :::
### Membership
If the training materials are open to everyone, why would anyone join as a
member?

I forsee these training materials, such as guides or PCE entries, to be thick
 and raw so that a newbie may get the same thing from them that picking up a
 scholastic book might give them. Innundation is no fun and is not helpful.
 Therefore the guides and encyclopedia are just the start.

We will eventually work that stuff into chunked lessons for which members will
pay.
