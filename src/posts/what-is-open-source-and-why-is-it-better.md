# What is OpenSource? Why is it Better or Needed

## What is Open Source?
'Open source', 'Opensource', and 'Free and Open Source Software'(FOSS) are terms
for an idea that sets of computer instructions are better off free to be used
and improved by the community. Free secondarily means free as in free beer.
Primarily it means it is without restriction or it come with as few restrictions
as possible. As it turns out, FOSS tends to be better because more eyes are on
it. It's less vulnerable to third parties injecting malicious insturctions into
the set because of this, those vulnerabilities can be fixed and re-released
instantly because the community isn't concerned with product launches, go-lives
or developed at a more rapid pace than private software.
