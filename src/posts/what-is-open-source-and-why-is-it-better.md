# What is OpenSource? Why is it Better or Needed

## What is Open Source?
'Open source', 'Opensource', and 'Free and Open Source Software'(FOSS) are terms
for an idea that sets of computer instructions are better off free to be used
and improved by the community. Free secondarily means free as in free beer.
Primarily it means it is without restriction or it come with as few restrictions
as possible. As it turns out, FOSS tends to be better because more eyes are on
it. It's less vulnerable to third parties injecting malicious instructions into
the set because of this, those vulnerabilities can be fixed and re-released
instantly because the community isn't concerned with product launches, go-lives
or developed at a more rapid pace than private software.

## What this has to do with Celtic Paganism?
Culture isn't different from software in that sets of instructions are analogous
with sets of behavior. Instruction is a bat term for a line of code because the
processor is compelled by physics to perform the instruction.

An open-access culture which doesn't operate in the dark can avoid systemic
abuses traditionally expected to be found in churches, orthodox, evangelical or
mormon societies. Treating culture like software, with vulnerabilities and
features, with tools and tasks, as a process which yields behavior and
experience as outputs. Culture can benefit from openness, tracking, freedom, and
licensing exactly like software can.

### Appropriation
A group of people taking a heritage they have access and rights to, tracking it
with perfect diligence, defining the praxes and precedents of it, and making it
available for acculturation, takes a bite out of appropriation. It doesn't just
pay it lip-service by a technical and legal loophole, open-sourcing a culture,
like open-sourcing software, eliminates the number of imitators because they
can just get the real T.

In our modern world, especially in North America, we are in a culture which produces
people who are longing and yearning for connection to something deeply rooted.
If you don't give them good information, they will imitate what they see and
fill in the holes.

It's bigger than simply the idea that indigenous people have nicer ceremonies
and we want them too. Often I see reconstructions looking like American-Indian
lookalikes, replacing warpaint with runes and headdresses with leather dangles.
A great number of American-Indians perform ceremony in suits or jeans because
materialism is a western ideal. The clothes making the man is not a tenant of
cultures which are dwelling in the same place where the homeland of their
language was fo
