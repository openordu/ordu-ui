# Working on the Hearth Keeper Outline

## The Outline

I think I have some parts of the outline really well done. Other parts I do not feel good about. I am continuing to work on it even though I do not feel good. I always feel good about the direction I'm going in but this time it just seems some of it is not nested correctly. I'm targeting specific senses when I should be targeting their overall containing abstractions. I'll get there. Tomorrow might be better, I have my covid booster so I may not be clear headed until Friday.
