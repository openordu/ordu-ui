I chose the name `openordú` because it means to me: an open order, an open preisthood. I'm not going to get a new domain name just yet. Cporg is fine still. Getting a new domain name _openordú.org_ or something, might be most appropriate to appearances, but the domain name _celticpaganism.org_ is most appropriate to the [goals](../goals.md) of the project.

I often question the extent to which I want to link the open clan, the Ó Déisí, and the bussiness of clan dynamics to all of this but each time I try to think about how it may be separate, feel like I'm embarking on an excercise in super colonial gymnastics. A culture cannot be separated from its people. So this project, while it can be use by clanless people or even other clans, groves, or covens, this work cannot be separated from Ó Déisí people because this open source effort represents the building of a culture which is always done naturally in a clan context.

However, OpenOrder works on two levels, the concept of a druid college, and the concept of orders of ritual, a notion about rites which predates but is codified in the earliest Celtic Church writings like the Stowe Missal and the Book of Deer.
