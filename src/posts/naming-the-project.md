I chose the name `openordú` because it means to me: an open order, an open
priesthood. I'm not going to get a new domain name just yet. Cporg has not yet
lost its value. Getting a new domain, such as name _openordú.org_ or something,
might be most appropriate to appearances, but the domain name
_celticpaganism.org_ is most appropriate to the [goals](../goals.md) of the
project.

I often question the extent to which I want to link the open clan, the Ó Déisí,
and the bushiness of clan dynamics to all of this but each time I try to think
about how it may be separate, feel like I'm embarking on an exercise in super
colonial gymnastics. A culture cannot be separated from its people. So this
project, while it can be use by clanless people or even other clans, groves, or
covens, this work cannot be separated from [Ó Déisí](/posts/letter-mission.html)
people because this open source effort represents the building of a culture
which is always done naturally within a clan context, within the context of the
people who are drawn together by its shared practice.

> A culture cannot be separated from its people.

However, OpenOrder works on two levels, the concept of a druid college, and the
concept of orders of ritual, a notion about rites which predates but is codified
in the earliest Celtic Church writings like the Stowe Missal and the Book of
Deer.
