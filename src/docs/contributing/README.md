## What Does Public Mean?
Check out the [License](license.md) to find out. There's a summary section.

## Why isn't Wikipedia Good?

Often it is good. But when we add to it, our changes get reverted by bots. There is a long process to get changes approved and this takes up more time than we have. We simply want to write what we know and grow it. Wikipedia also doesn't stand to support Celtic Paganism(CP), though it has played an important role in educating newbies, this site is CP facing.

## What About Mary

[AKA Mary Jones](http://maryjones.us) is one of the greatest resources for Celtic pagans. We have permission from Mary to Contribute her work here. Some of the pronunciations and translations are off, and articles are now outdated. This is a way to remedy that and for that work to live on as the [PCE](/public-celtic-encyclopedia/).
