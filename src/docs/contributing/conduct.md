# Code of Conduct
## Preamble

As an organization, Clan Ó Déisi emphasizes the importance of building
relationships. We seek to create relationships with the Déithe and with each
other. We also strive to express virtue and honor our words and actions. Of
these virtues, hospitality and integrity have the most obvious impact on our
interpersonal relationships.

## Summary
Hospitality is a virtue that includes responsibilities for both the guest and
host to be considerate, and to work together to create a safe space for each
other. Within The Déisi Clan, part of that responsibility includes an intolerance for
behaviors that show abuse, hate, discrimination, or racism in any form. This
means that we are considerate of others and respect their right to define what
happens to themselves. This also means that we do not act without consent.

Integrity reflects in how we treat each other. It is expected that Clan members keep their word, treat everyone with kindness and respect, do not tell falsehoods, and do not spread gossip. This does not mean that we should not have difficult or corrective conversations, but that those should be done with integrity.

Members and guests of The Déisi Clan are expected to follow this Code of Conduct in
all our spaces, both in-person and online, and at any time that they are
representing The Déisi Clan. Failure to follow this code will result in corrective
action that may include suspension or removal from The Déisi Clan.

## Definitions
“The Déisi Clan” is a confederation of septs that take the work Openordú produces and
practice it. The name of The Déisi Clan is the Ó Déisi clan, an artificial clan from
the 4th century which became a real one. We redefine this artificail clan as a
designation for the group which forms around this project as a culture.

“Minor” is a person under the age of consent as defined by the laws of the
physical location of the event or the person’s location in the case of online
events. In the case that the location does not have a defined age of consent,
the age of majority will define if someone is a minor.

“Adult” is a person at or over the age of majority as defined by the laws of the
physical location of the event or the person’s location in the case of online
events.

“Authorized Adult” is the parent, legal guardian, or adult sibling of the minor;
or an adult that has been approved by the parent or legal guardian as defined
below. The parent or legal guardian of the children must approve of the adults
in writing/email prior to the event, or in-person/text to the event leader or designee.

For sept-specific events, written/email permission may be granted ahead of time
and for multiple events to the sept organizers or officers for a period of no
more than 12 months. Event organizers are expected to verify that a parent gave
permission for each adult who is authorized to be alone with the minor child.

::: tip
These regulations function as the basis for the condification of this
confederacy. That our first document is this and not a constituion represents
that the people we want to join us value people's experiences over idenity.
:::

In the case of emancipated minors, they may designate an authorized adult as if they were their own parent. Minors may be required to show proof of emancipation.
You can find an example Child Care Authorization form at Rocket Lawyer but any
similar form may be used.

“Reasonable Person” is a legal term defined by Merriam-Webster Dictionary as “a fictional person with an ordinary degree of reason, prudence, care, foresight, or intelligence whose conduct, conclusion, or expectation in relation to a particular circumstance or fact is used as an objective standard by which to measure or determine something (as the existence of negligence)”

In practice this means that: if other similar people (same demographics) in
similar situations would agree that something is harmful, then it is.

## Behavioral Expectations
Clan Members and guests at Clan events are expected to behave in a way that is
acceptable to The Déisi Clan.

Unacceptable behavior includes but is not limited to:

Verbal, written, electronic, or physical harassment that targets an individual
or group on the basis of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age,
gender, gender expression, gender identity, sexual orientation, spiritual
practices, nation or culture of origin, theological belief, physical appearance,
relationship status, physical abilities, disability, identity, profession,
military status, organizational role, or any other factor.

Deliberate assault, intimidation, bullying, defamation, stalking, or any other
behavior that would cause a reasonable person distress or alarm.

Repeated disruption of rituals, presentations, meetings, festivals, or
conversations on-line or in person (including repeated disruptive behavior
resulting from intoxication from recreational substances or drugs).

Unwelcome, non-emergency, physical contact, sexual advances, or harassment. Only an explicit “yes” means yes. “No”, or silence, means no. Practice consent at all times.
Minors are unable to give consent to sexual acts with adults under any
circumstances.

Individuals who are unconscious, intoxicated or in an altered state are unable
to give consent for any form of sexual act or for the consumption of anything
that may harm them.

Consent may be withdrawn at any time.

Non-consensual, non-sexual, physical contact in order to provide medical services or to ensure an individual’s safety during an emergency is permitted but should be minimized.

Intentionally creating a situation that would make a reasonable individual feel unsafe

Encouragement of any of these listed behaviors.

Required behaviors include:

* Reasonable care for the safety and well-being of oneself,
* any minors in one’s charge,
* and fellow adults/minors

Sexual offenders do not belong to The Déisi Clan and legal conviction or
confession of sexual crimes means the convicted belong to the Na hEasonóracha,
The Dishonored.

Conduct specific to minors and adults working with minors at Clan Events.

Minors are unable to give consent to sexual acts with adults under any circumstance.
There should be no close one-on-one contact between a minor and an unrelated
adult who is not an authorized adult.

At no point should a single unrelated adult be in an area with a minor that is
out-of-sight of other adults without express permission of the minor’s
authorized adult.

The two-adult rule is not in effect if the adult is the child’s authorized adult
The two-adult rule is not in effect in the case of emergencies that are
life-threatening or require the minor to be transported to medical care.

## What if you see unacceptable behaviors or are a target of these behaviors?

If you notice someone at a Déisi function, in a Déisi space, or who is representing Ó Déisi exhibiting the above behaviors, you are expected to reach out to the people responsible for that space. You may approach the individual to point out the unacceptable behavior in a respectable manner IF you feel safe doing so, but we encourage you to report the behavior to the appropriate responsible parties.

The responsible parties are as follows:

Behavior that breaks the law of the location of the event including child abuse or sexual mis-conduct – local law enforcement
At festivals or in-person Ó Déisi events – follow any guidelines for reporting bad behavior, reach out to the organizers of the event, reach out to the grove leaders if it is a grove event
Facebook – Please use the facebook tools to report the post to the Social Media Team
Emails – Forward the offending email to openordu@gmail.com.
Zoom – Direct message the organizer or identified moderator with details of the offense
For Ó Déisi in general or for grievous offenses – email the openordu@gmail.com. If appropriate, also contact the local authorities.

## Overlap with other events, orgs and sub-groups
Ó Déisi sub-groups, social spaces, and festivals may have their own Code of Conduct. Any other Code of Conduct is in addition to this Ó Déisi Code of Conduct.

## Corrective Action
Corrective action may include, but are not limited to, any of the following depending on the intent, severity, and frequency of the action and the location where the action occurred.

## Social Media Post moderation

severity, and frequency of the action.
