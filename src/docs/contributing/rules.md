# Repository Rules

Repository rules are loose guides on how to make good contributions. This guide
on good contributions is from the project [un.curl.dev](http://un.curl.dev).

## Mimic existing style
Copy another article of a similar type to the one you wish to create. Blow away
the author and contributors [frontmatter]() tags, and use the article as a
template.

If you are editing an existing piece of content, go with the existing structure
of the content unless your main work is to restructure the article.

## Keep it simple
Don't seek multiple goals at a time such as restructuring and content addition.
Treat those as two separate tasks and make one set of changes per goal.

## Probe
Ask people involved in the project about the change you want to make before
doing so. This empowers you with the most information to procede. If you do not
do this you will be frustrated with people seemingly shooting you down all the
time or presenting obstacles which you could have foreseen.

Maybe someone has considere your change and prioritized it differently, work
with them.

## Minimum first shot
Commit to your branch the minimum first shot. Usually this is 80% of the core of
your idea. Build that first, and then ask for feedback. Communicate that this is
a Minimum First Shot(MFS) draft so the expectation that it is imperfect and
incomplete will stave any anxiety one has about sharing unfinished work and
having it judge. Your MFS should be some element of terrible or you as a
contributor are doing something wrong.

## Act on Feedback
Go with the feedback you get without sacrificing your idea. I have seen good
ideas poopoo'ed that recieved an initial amount of scholarship, which were later
praised as some of the highest works in the pagan world. Therefore, if your idea
is good, and is in the data, and you are disagreed with, there is a way to
accept feedback and criticism, while fighting for your idea in a noble and
respectful way.

Suspicion and doubt give way to reason and evidence. If people aren't getting
your idea, it can be resolved by demonstrating a mound of evidence that is
considerably higher than the mound of criticism a theory recieves.

If you think the feedback you recieve is too stringent, or makes you jump
through too many hoops, cite more sources than you want to, consider that you
may be over-romanticizing the study Celtic Paganism. We seek to reach an
Academic standard found in Anthropological Studies on many of our articles.
Taking that data, and gnosis, and packaging it up for the lay practictioner is
our work.

## Negative feedback
As a project member, you are expected to recieve public criticism in a stoic
manner. Therefore we are seeking only reasonable people who can control their
innersense of equanimity. Open source projects, and pagan project criticism end
up being a small set of valid concerns amid the dreggs of a cesspool of
intellectual garbage. We've all engaged in it, this isn't the place for flaming,
fights. Be an adult and fork the project and schism like a real person would.
