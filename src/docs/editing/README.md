# Editing
Editing is done through the formation of `markdown`. Markdown is a way to
structure text so that it translates into html content. See this small sample
below:

This output: _this text is italicized_ is rendered from this Markdown:

```md
_This text is italicized_
```

This set of pages document a bit about the Markdown supported by this project.
