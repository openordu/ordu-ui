## What is this Project?

This is a project called the **_[Openord√∫](https://www.github.com/openordu/)_**
which features a **_[Public Celtic
Encyclopedia(PCE)](https://www.github.com/openordu/pce)_**. It exists as a
resource guide supporting the practice of Celtic Paganism. The Texts in these
repositories are released under the [Celtic Culture Attribution Share Alike 4.0
International](/license.md).

### Project Parts
| Repository   | Contains         |

| sacred-texts | Public domain translations of myth and folklore |
| guides       | Study Programs |
| praxes       | rites, customs, charms, prayers |

## Praxes
The number one complaint from new celtic pagans regarding good books on CP is
that people read them, they know how to form a worldview, they know what the
ancestors who worshiped their gods believed; they can pick from those beliefs as
if it were a menu from which to chose one's own belief system... but they still
don't tell you what the hell to do. Especially when you're really feeling it and
want to have some level of spontaneity.

People aren't given a vocabulary of religious expressions outside of offerings
or prayers, unique expressions they can pass on.

## What Does Public Mean?
Check out the [License](/license.md) to find out. There's a summary section.

## Why isn't Wikipedia Good?

Often it is good. But when we add to it, our changes get reverted by bots. There
is a long process to get changes approved and this takes up more time than we
have. We simply want to write what we know and grow it. Wikipedia also doesn't
stand to support Celtic Paganism(CP), though it has played an important role in
educating newbies, this site is CP facing.

## What About Mary

[AKA Mary Jones](http://maryjones.us) is one of the greatest resources for
Celtic pagans. We have permission from Mary to [contribute](/docs/contribute/ )
her work here. Some of the pronunciations and translations are off, and articles
are now outdated. This is a way to remedy that and for that work to live on as
the [PCE](/public-celtic-encyclopedia/).
