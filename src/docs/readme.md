## Why isn't Wikipedia Good?

Often it is good. But when we add to it, our changes get reverted by bots. There is a long process to get changes approved and this takes up more time than we have. We simply want to write what we know and grow it. Wikipedia also doesn't stand to support Celtic Paganism(CP), though it has played an important role in educating newbies, this site is CP facing.

## What About Mary

[AKA Mary Jones](http://maryjones.us) is one of the greatest resources for Celtic pagans. Like Wikipedia, we can't add to it, but Jones's Celtic Encyclopedia(JCE) it has certainly inspired our [PCE](/public-celtic-encyclopedia/).
