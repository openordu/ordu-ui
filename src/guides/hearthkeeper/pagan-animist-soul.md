## Dividuals
When Westerners read this article, they will not understand it unless they read [Animism, Dividualism and the Soul](animism-dividualism-soul) first.

**TLDR**:
* The Animist soul is particulate, with parts
* Animists have neither individuals nor collectives but rather dividuals
* Animists dividuate the tribe and nature too
* Spirits are born of affordances of natural happenings
* Animism isn't the belief in a vital for in everything
* Animism is the belief in beings dwelling in _some_ inanimate objects
* Animists do not have a body/mind division
* Animists have a strong Society vs Nature dichotomy
* Western language very often imposes an dividualistic frame over our individualism
* Yeats' Fairies operate like the Nayakan Devaru in these regards

## The Pagan Soul
Celtic pagan notions of the soul have been lost to us. But one can be rebuilt by comparative mythology and folklore, easily. So what we do is look to several of our Indo-European neighbors, who aren't just neighbors, but siblings or sister-cultures in a family of Indo-European language and myth. We analyze their lore and we always find threads of our own folklore within that framing. If we make guesses as to what we'll find based on the rules of another frame, our guesses end up true, we have what is called a theory that attempts to explain thing, not proven, but a candidate. Our guesses being right is a sign our system and methods of reconstruction work to explain things we didn't have the explanation for before. One of those things is the soul and how it interacts with gods, spirits, family, the world and the afterlife and spirit travel.

Among Germanic paganisms, there is a perceivable unity of thinking about the soul[^first]. The roots of these are only intact in the Norse language but the other languages have enough remnants to confirm the Norse tripartite soul. The three Norse terms for the soul are Hamr, Huge, and Fylgja. The term Fylgja translates to 'female follower'. She is a tutelary god and ancestor or a person's family member[^second]. One person can have multiple Fylgjur and the more one had, the stronger they were believed to be. When a Fylgja is fighting enemies of a person, the enemies get sleepy and start yawning. The Fylgjur leaves a person's body when a person falls asleep. A person's Fylgjur are connected to their destiny and fate, and therefore fate goddesses.

In one account a man Gisli sees what one might describe as a _benevolent_ woman and a _maleficent_ woman, one promising to care for his soul and the other giving him death omens by spraying him with blood and covering him with a bonnet. Lecouteax recounts a man named 'An' is visited by a nightmare figure who stabs him in the stomach and pulls out his entrails. He lies dead having a second dream or vision that she is putting his entrails back in and he feels good about this interaction. The Anglo Saxon Faecce and Irish Fetch, when analyzed seem really to be a bean sidhe, have all of these traits in common. That Fylgja and Banshee share roles as fate givers. The prime directive of the Fylgja or Double is protecting the person they follow.

The Norse Hamr is the same as the Saami Hamle which is another double separate from the Fylgja. It appears as a mirror image of the person or a close relative. The animalistic nature of the Fylgja isn't found as much concerning the Hamr but is there. The Hamr on the other hand can act corporeally whereas the Fylgja can only wander, observe, appear, and protect[^third]. The Fylgja departs from a doomed person while the Hamr remains in the body until it is fully decayed.

The term Hamrammr refers to persons who have a powerful Hamr. Eigi Einhamr refers to persons with more than one Hamr and literally, means 'Not with only one double'. There are also references to people with the ability to double themselves. 'Vixla Homum' and 'Kipta Homum' mean to 'change form', 'hamask' signifies that it's both passive and active as a practice, or rather voluntary or involuntary. 'Hamhleypa' means "to flow into one's double" or often "letting one's double run"[^fourth].

The biggest risk a double of any kind takes when journeying is not being able to re-enter the body. This is why the body isn't to be disturbed or the traveler's name isn't to be spoken nor they spoken to. The Hungarian Shamans called a figure 'Taltos' to engage in combat with their doubles as horses, flames, and bulls.

The Hugr is used to describe thought as well as the animus. It has a will and can instantiate, but it is considered to be all about and within parts of nature. This is related to the Irish word for Anam which comes from the same roots as Animus. Proto Celtic *anaman is a noun from a verb meaning '[that which makes one] remain'. It's important to note that when the soul leaves the body, the breath ceases in every account that describes lifelessness. It's almost as if we're genius loci of our body through the breath, and when we leave the body, our ability to 'remain' diminishes with time or disturbances to the body.

Ulfilas(311 - 383), bishop of the Visigoths and originator of their alphabet uses 'hugs' to mean thought. Breath is tied to thought, it possible to see Apam Napat as a kind of soul of the cosmos, having come out of the void waters, the thought that portioned and aritificed the world from the first sacrifice. This is why traces of evidence locating the realm of the dead at Sea exist before it shifted to subterranian location. The location of the Dead in Irish lore is at Sea and the dead stowe away on the boats of fishermen.

Anglo Saxon words for the soul are rooted in other words meaning 'sea'. It appears that Hugr is both the thought and consciousness in all the world and the world's breath. But it is, in limited form and scope, our thoughts and motivations. If you believe you will go to another place when you die, it's your 'Hugr' that is the "you" that is going there. It's synonymous in this sense with the Greek 'nous' and is used as such to mean 'mind'. Along with nous, it's synonymous with the word 'mens' or mind like the Slavic moon god Mensis.

Regis Boyer lists them as such: "Visited(Hugr), Inhabited(Hamr), accompanied(Fylja)." Regis also destroys any dichotomy between corporeal and incorporeal nature of the soul and body or any of these parts saying, "if we are to grasp this concept in all its richness and uniqueness, we must, where physical and mental are indivisible, give up our unimaginative oppositions." [^fifth]. Lecouteax says, "The idea of a single and indivisible soul, then, is foreign to Germanic paganism, the best representative of our far-reaching ancestors and more generally, of the Indo-European peoples to whom this concept of the soul is fundamentally unknown."

Dáithí Ó hÓgáin writes of Irish Belief, "Stories were told of how the soul could be sometimes seen, in the shape of a little bird, a butterfly or a bee, flying out fro the mouth of a sleeping person and returning before he awoke. The person might then describe a dream which he had, a dream based on what the soul saw when it had teporarily left the body."[^6]. This reference doesn't carry the name of the animal spirit as vehicle for the dreamer, but the animal is itself there.

Gregory the Great's Fourth Book discusses the afterlife, death, and the soul, and the three spirits which inhabit the self. The first is a spirit which isn't embodied, the spirit doesn't die. The second one is a 'spirit covered in flesh' which doesn't die either, and the third is 'covered in flesh' and dies with the body. While this Gregory relates them as angelic, human, and animal souls, however, these are the Fylgic double, the Hugr, and Hamr or the Fylgja, the Hamr, and simply the breath. Lecouteux says, "The Angelic spirit corresponds to the psychic Double(daimon, genius, fylgja); the second, the one that does not die with the flesh, to the physical Double (hamr) or the shamanistic soul of bones; and the third is simply soul as the breath of life."[^7].  In these accounts, the angelic spirit is a bird that flies out of the mouth of a monk who is dying during prayer.

Gregory of Tours writes that principally the soul is unseen and that those who can see the subtle parts have had their "eye of the spirit", or 'mentis oculum', purified through faith and prayer. Gregory reported that Armentarius' soul left his body traveling and heard Greek while on his journey and was able to repeat Greek when he returned, a language he hadn't any knowledge of before his journey.

Bringing back knowledge that you didn' have before, like insight you can test, is the key point when discerning between a vision journey and an imagined fantasy. Saami who would find items were professional spirit-travelers. This implies certain gaurentees applied to the profession.

In the fascination of Gylfi, Thor travels in a cart with Loki and arrives at a farmer's house at dusk. They were granted stay and Thor slaughtered the goats who were pulling his cart. They ate all the parts of it except for the bones and skins and Thor placed the skins between the fire and the door while the dwellers of the home placed the bones on the skins. The farmer's son Thjafi cracks one of the bones during the meal. Thor waves his hammer over the goats the next morning and they come to life again but one is limping. Saint Germain has this same story told of him replacing Thor.

A 1390 account taken by Fra Beltamino, an Inquisitor from Cernuscullo interrogates Sibilia and Pierina who describe being involved in a night procession of Diana and Herodias. During these they say, cows are killed and eaten, their bones placed on the skins and then they are brought back to life but are no longer able to work. Lecouteux believes these to be from a common source of Indo-European belief.

To the Turko-Tartars and the Siberians, bones house the subtle soul. Bones aren't to be broken and are buried so the animal can be reborn. So the bones can be a residing place for the Double. Lecouteux recounts a story of the Cathar where one leaves his body like a lizard coming out of his mouth and their concept of the soul showing their belief that the 'soul' permanently resided in the body while the 'spirit' goes in and out[^8]. Emmanuel Le Roy Laduri in Jacques Furnier's Register echoes this belief calling it heresy to believe that there are two 'substances' in man, one that stays and one that leaves. A proponent of heretical faith, he believes a good spirit enters a person if they become a believer or heretic and an evil one enters them if they renounce it[^9].

In these accounts, the soul is the "vital principle" or the breath, the animus that remains. The spirit is the same as the Greek daimon or Roman genius except for having any traits of a tutelary deity, this leaves and returns to the body. In the Cathar case, this personal daimon, maybe even the ego, becomes a lizard that comes out of the mouth of the person traveling. The 'soul' is in the bones or blood and the spirit roams and shifts its shape. William Fort in Montaillou recounted a woman named Arnaude who saw that the different souls within people had their parts, heads, limbs, and everything.

Dáithí Ó hÓgáin writes, "The most essential of bodily elements is, of course, the blood." and "Blood was considered synonymous with individuality and so it was used to gaurentee agreements." as well as "...traits of character were thought to be hereditary or to 'run in families'. A person might be describe as having a 'good drop' or a 'bad drop'[^10] in him if his actions were seen to be of a type with those of his ancestors." This here shows a _part_-iculate soul.

The Homeric belief was that the psuche, or vital principle as Aristotle defined it, could become an eidolon or a phantom[^11]. This is very close to the Hamr without the ability for it to act corporeally, yet like it, the eidolon is a human look-alike and doesn't appear often as an animal.
