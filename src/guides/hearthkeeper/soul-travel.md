## Ecstasy
We have accounts of Pagan Ecstatic Practice as well as Christian Ecstatic practice which gives us clues on the nature of the soul in a Pagan worldview.

'Ecstatic' comes from Greek 'ekstasis' from ek 'out' and histemi 'I stand' meaning out of proper place, displacement, and leaving the body. Ecstasy is the state experienced under induced psychosis by means of plants and fungi, dancing, fasting, chanting or any other form of asceticism.

Ecstasy is easier for some people than others, and so it is a function of heredity with psychic gifts often running in families. Belief is not required for ecstasy. Some people whose predisposition for beleif comes at odds with their experience might end up like Barbara Ehrenreich who devoted her life to chasing down her own mystical expereinces academically[^1]. Experience with the soul isn't necessarily predicated on a belief in the soul or its parts.

When people do Seidr, Astral Projection, Shamanism, have Out of Body Expperiences, Psychadelic or Mystical expereineces, they are expeiriencing and ecstacy. Mosh pits, Drum Circles, Seances, Parades are all types of group ecstasy.

Ecstasy is a process that involves ego death and rebirth. Lecouteux says, "Ecstasy is a temporary death, an initiation. We can recall the pagans who slept on tombs to have revelations and came back from their sleep with gifts."[^2]. Hallbjorn in the Saga of Thorleif falls asleep on a burial mound trying to say a poem in honor of the deceased and dreams that the ghost Thorleif unties his tongue consequently giving him excellent poetic ability. The Tripartite Nature of the Pagan and Christian souls in these contexts is not a coincidence. In all these cases, the otherworld, the one full of hidden things, and this world are both reachable by the 'spirit double'.

## Christian Mystical Expieriences
According to Lecouteax, the common Mystical experiences of the laity were copted by the church as having come from Saints and Monks so that they could reshape and manipulate these stories to contain Christian doctrine and so they could create the false narrative that only holy people experience ecstasy.

Nevertheless, many of the Christian mystics express deep worry when their experience of ecstasy doesn't reflect their doctrine, but instead reaffirms pagan belief.

In the ecstatic accounts where the traveler is Christian, the person leaving their body faces a "tribunal of God, of Christ" or “He brought himself before the Judge.”[^3]. This is the expereince described in Bardos in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. In the third Bardo, the Judge is Yama, the Vedic god of the realm of the Dead[^4].

Lecouteax iterates over accounts from Godeschalk, Bede, Fursy, Stephan the Roman, Guibert of Nogent, Tondale, Sibyllina Biscossi Da Pavis, et al. In all of them the traveler has no knowledge of the amount of time that has passed between the beginning and ending of their journey. Time dialation is one of the biggest themes and motifs in folk tales, and this relates back to direct expereinces of having longer or shorter journeys than the amount of time allows for the experience.

Christian accounts are often uncomfortable with the fact that the body of the traveler can come back with wounds their soul expereinced during the traveling. Godeschalc writes, “for the soul is of a single nature (natural simplex) and, not being formed of different parts, it does not allow itself to be divided and cannot, therefore, leave the body and stay in it, otherwise, the man would not really be dead.” What is indivisible cannot be wounded, and therefore Christian expereinces was a particulate one while the doctrine of the soul was a monolithic one. Godeschalc himself had had wounds on his body that he suffered only in his vision lasting six months after his ecstasy. Godeschalc ventures in his double while he is in a coma fully unconscious.

Christians believed that bad illusory ecstasies were sent by Satan and good, truely prophetic ones were sent by God. Pagans didn't distinguish between visions and dreams in their accounts, however Christian accounts hold that dreams occured to the soul while the soul was in the body, but that it left the body during visions and traveled in a subtle-body.

## Dreams

Communication with the Otherworld in dreams is universal to all cultures[^5]. Jacques le Goff write's that dreams were sent by _Visio Spiritualis_ or _Visio Intelletualis_. These kinds of visions among vassals short circuit the intermediaries of a preisthood, Christian or Pagan. That Pagans celebrated such ecstasies means they didn't mind these initiated-by-nature vassals. If these priesthoods were soley hegemonies like the Christian ones were, you'd expect to see pagan priesthoods to put more of a clamp down on commoner-mystics, but we don't see that.

In the saga of the Jomsborg Vikings, King Harold was seen as weak for not dreaming and his daughter will not marry Gorm if he cannot dream. Germanic folk tradition believes that a person tossing or turning shouldn’t be awakened so they can ‘njota’: enjoy their dreams. The Icelandic word draumstolinn means “someone from whom dreams have been stolen”. Draumamaðr, ‘dream-man’, is a word for someone who has ample dreams[^6]. Clear dreaming and prophetic dreaming were family traits and passed down.

Lecoutreux writes “To the pre-Christian mindset, sleep permits the free movement of genies, spirits, and Doubles and distance presents no obstacle whatsoever.” and “As long as the body does not completely decompose, the Double does not disappear.”[^6]. Bodvar asks his mother why her sleep was restless and she responded with “I took a witch’s ride to many places this night, and I learned with certainty things I did not know before.” The styling of witch’s ride, grandreið, has riðr in it related to the raido rune marrying the journeying of the soul to travel.

Gunnar relays to Kolskeggr the forms taken by a murderer’s double, seeing the assassin as a wolf in one dream and a viper in another on the second night. In the Saga of Vavard of the Ice Fjord, a sorcerer named Thorgrim spread a coat over his head after becoming sleepy on his horse. He returns to himself having gone to Havard’s farm as a fox leading his eighteen wolves. Atli sees this and relays it after his companions, Thorgrim’s enemies, wake him from restlessness. Gunnar also sees a similar situation where wolves ambush him and later it comes to pass[^7]. Fylgja is the term used in these tales for this double.

::: tip
Dáithí Ó hÓgáin writes of Irish Belief, "Stories were told of how the soul could be sometimes seen, in the shape of a little bird, a butterfly or a bee, flying out fro the mouth of a sleeping person and returning before he awoke. The person might then describe a dream which he had, a dream based on what the soul saw when it had teporarily left the body."[^8]. This reference doesn't carry the name of the animal spirit as vehicle for the dreamer, but the animal is itself there.

## Thought
Regis Boyer demonstrates a _congruety_ between Celtic and Germanic pagan beliefs, and in both the double or doubles were carrying the soul, appearing as apparitions and visions that allowed the pagan to remain in constant contact with the spiritual world. Hamfor, meaning outward form, from Hamr, was another name for the double which carries the soul. Another name, grandreið from gandr, meant wolf, dragon, and demon-animal.

The snake and wolves in Gunnar’s visions are the automatic projections of the alter egos of their attackers: Thorgrim and the assassins after Otradal. Thorgrim is conscious while on a horse, gets off as he starts venturing, and only becomes unconscious when he sees his destination and becomes distraught. While Atli is sleeping restlessly a pack of wolves numbering the same as is in Thorgrim’s party led by a female fox. Here we may have an association with wolves and warriors and sorcerers with foxes. In another vision, Gunnar falls asleep and after waking says he was riding near Knafaholar and was attacked by wolves who were the dream alter egos of those who attacked him in an ambush. The word for this psychic double in these tales sagas is fylgja[^9].

The alter ego leaves spontaneously or for many reasons. One of them is that a person calls the alter ego of other people with hugr(thought). This happened when Gudmund’s double appears to Snorri after he is oppressed by a Giant[^10]. Another method is controlling the double as a professional ecstatic. These professionals can springa af harmi or “leap out of their skin” and springa af moeði or “out of their spirit”.

::: Tip
The Irish word for thought that matches the meaning of Hugr is rún(prn the same as rune) because it also means desire or will, like your inner-most motivations which generate your thoughts. So the rún, like the Hugr, does the thoughts while also meaning thought.

## This-worldly Travel

In the Saga of the Lakevale Chiefs, three Saami attempt to find an amulet Ingimund had lost. He promises to trade resources for their finding it. They were only able to tell Ingimund of the countryside the amulet was in so he could recognize the place if he sailed there. They go into isolation to do this, ask no one to speak their names, and sigh heavily when returning to their bodies. When the alter ego wants to leave, sleep comes upon the person or they begin yawning. A Bandit in one of Aesop’s fables also yawns to signify he will turn into a wolf[^11].

This can leave parts of the soul out of the body, it can cause sickness or depression. To these Sami, speaking their name put them in danger. Yawning also appears in the tale about Hauk Habrok, a witch(heixr) yawns to prognosticate injury. In this example, the person doesn’t journey but leaves their body in their double and uses it to see someone’s fated wounds.

In the Feroiens Saga, Thrand asks that no one speaks, journeys into the underworld in his double to speak with those slain by the sons of Thorgrim. He sighed when he finally rose from his seat. A frequent yawner was believed to be bewitched by a spell(35). Sick persons who yawned were believed to be soon to die. Spirits could possess a person when they yawned.

The Historia Norwegiae was written in the 12th century and contains a chapter on professional practices of ecstatic doubling by the Sami. In it, two magicians try to fight a ‘gandus’ or gandr to bring back a woman who had died. The second succeeded but the first failed and brought wounds back with him. His gandus transformed into a whale while the enemy gandus transformed into spikes on the floor of the sea(36). In this account, they divine in a bowl, the forms the enemy gandus take, and then use those to follow or keep up with the target.

The chase between Gwion Bach and Cerredwen are prime examples of a Celtic version of Gandus battles.

## Shapeshifting

The shapes in the bowl were a whale, a deer, and a boat with oars. These signified the forms that the enemy Gandus took when traveling over snow, mountains, and deep swamps. This is a clear drawing from some loric associations that the Magician has.

The Saami would trade fabric, bows, and services for finding items at a distance or far away. Olaus Magnus write in 1555 that the Saami hit a hammer on a bronze serpent or frog seated on an anvil, swings the hamer around in a circle saying charms. After collapsing into an ecstatic trance, he lie on the ground while his wife ensures he isn't disturbed even by insects. In Olaus account, this Saami brings back the object and gives it to the client but this is a clear omission of the word knowledge. The original or unembelish account should have read "brings back [knowledge of] the object."

These beleifs were still alive three years before the ninteenth century in Jacob Smaosvend, a Saami, who was contracted to find information by Johannes Dolling from Lubeck. He does a circular dance to enter trance.  In 1704, the Protean Imp has a chapter called “The North Bothnians, Excellent Necromancers”, which is about Saami who take any form at will to learn what their enemies are up to[^12].

What the Christian mystics call charisma or divine will, the Saami regarded as a result of scientific exploration. It is achieved by illness and asceticism essentially a worn-out body or by trance induction by chant and rhythm.

::: warning
The Christian division between body and soul was foreign to the European peasantry and is therefore absent from the accounts of the lay mystics and the earliest records[^13]. Nurit Bird-David's research in [Animism](animism-dividualism-soul) shows us that this lack of division is universal on all five contients.

[^4]:  Yama's Indo-European cognate in Germanic Paganism is Ymir, both are the first primordial to die. Yama is a primodial and often considered the twin of Mannus(Man), who once dies goes to a realm which, Yama has homesteaded having died before Mannus. Yama means twin in Sanskrit and stems from *yémHos proto-Indo-European which means 'paired'. Yama is man's Double. The Celtic cognate to Yama is Donn who doesn't share a linguistic connection but shares the mythological roles of Yama. Donn homesteads the otherworld wilderness in Ireland having become the first mortal to die. Donn rides in the Wild hunt serving as a Judge in a tribunal over souls that are out of body.
