## Men of Truth
Druids, particularly those who relay placelore, are called the men of truth in a poem in the LGE.

> His grave is there according to men of truth,
  Although he had no power among saints:
  Silent was his sleep under resting places 
  which are no pilgrimage-way for our scholars. â€” Ua Flaind
