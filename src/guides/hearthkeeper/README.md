# Traditional Roles
## Householder
Usually the eldest man or, the land renter or owner in the absense of a man. If the fire in the hearth went out, it could only be kindled by the householder who acted as a kind of house-priest. Kindling a fire in a sacred way is always a reenactment of the same act in mythology. The Householder always sat closest to the fire on the right hand side of the hob.

## Hearthkeeper
Usually the eldest or youngest woman in the home. If the wife or maiden daughter of the Householder were good at their domestic duties were called a 'good cricket'. Crickets were one of the primary forms of hearth sprits or house-gods who are under the rule of the hearth goddess. This person tended the fire, smoored it, said charms over it, and sat to the left of it.

## Modernizing these roles
Though these roles were very strickly asigned in the past, it is our responsiblity to remake our paganism not to reinforce hegemonies. Therefore these roles can be swapped and occupied by a person of a different gender than tradition hold. They can be alternated, or even combined into one person.

## A Guide for Both

Though this is called the Hearthkeeper's Guide, this guide serves to both educate and enable a person interested in Celtic Paganism to do the practice of regualr people.

::: tip
The strategy here is to focus on what to do with these articles and be 'light' on the knowledge of why. If they want to know why we can expand the topics here which relate to different disciplines in the guides for those disciplines.

::: danger
The key here is to write about a topic outlined while considering the other topics. Keep early oulined items simple and get more complex as you go.

## Book III
- Appendix I: the indo-european comparative reconstructionist methodology(IECRM)

- *don, meaning "earth" > Koch, John T. Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2006. pp.1693-1695 Dummonii

> In order to be at peace, it is necessary to feel a sense of history – that you are both part of what has come before and part of what is yet to come. Being thus surrounded, you are not alone; and the sense of urgency that pervades the present is put in perspective. — Elisabeth Kubler-Ross

> Of these three, the Gatekeeper is the most immediate and ‘human’. Gatekeeper God/desses are usually in close relation with humankind. They are compassionate, humorous and skilled; though they may set stern tests or even be tricksters at times. So we offer to them with honor and seek their wisdom and support. — Ian Corrigan
