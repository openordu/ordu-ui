# A Short Intro to the Holy Ones

## Earth Mother

## Sky Father
The word *diw or possibly *dyu, from where the words Iu in Iupiter and Dé and Tuatha Dé both come, means the light and brightness of the day[^1].

There's a group of descendants of this word in every Indo-European language. The Christian word for god Dia, descents from the Sky father named *Dyaus.

## The Gods
The Indo-Europeans spoke of 'the gods' as a group as well as about each and every specific deity. The word 'god' is neuter and gender neutral[^2] and comes from PIE _*g^h^u-to-_ and parallels the Sanskrit word _hu_ meaning 'to pour out, make offering'. The Main Priest in Vedic rites was called the _hotar_. The Germanic word god and its relatives mean then 'those worshiped with libations'.

The Greeks used _theos_ from _θσ-φατο_ meaning 'god-spoken', while the Slavic peoples use _bog_ or _baga_ which is linguistically cousins with _Bhagavan_ in India.

_Bhaj_ means 'dispense' and _bhaga_ are the blessings 'dispensed' by the grace of the gods. There for the Slavonic _bogu_ are the dispensers of fate and blessings. These are cognate to the Greek _δαμων_.

The number of gods are different in each Indo-European culture, and there is no cause to think that an ancient systemic numbering exists commong to all of them. These categorizations do hold one commonality: that later people will analize and explain earlier people's lore.
