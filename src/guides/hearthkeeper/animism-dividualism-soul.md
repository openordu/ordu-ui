# Animism, Dividualism and the Soul
## What is Animism
Animism is the beleif that inanimate objects can be inhabited by hidden beings.
People recognize which inanimate objects are hidden by certain affordances and
agencies. These beings are separate from, though possibly made of, the vital
force that Animist societies see within everything. However, some otherworldly
beings lack divinity or this vital force and feed upon humans to nourish
themselves. So Animism is not synonymous with the belief that everything is
alive, rather that is known in cultural anthropology as Animatism. Animism
specifically involves divinities living in rocks, rivers, hills and trees,
towns, homes, and other, hidden, worlds. In [The Pagan Animist
Soul](pagan-animist-soul), we discuss how the vital force in everything is but
one soul-part to the soul, and not the one that makes a being sentient.

It's presented in Encyclopedias as "religious beliefs involving the attribution
of life or divinity to such natural phenomena as trees, thunder, or celestial
bodies"[^second]. Imagine how childish it is to ascribe life to a tree, silly
pagans. Clearly these are not well thought out, thus misleading.

To modern people, the word divinity means an immenent vitality rather than a
local deity. However, when cultural anthropology was created, Animism
specifically concerns itself with sentiences that dwell within, and are
responsible for the functioning of all parts of nature, including urban cities.

In the view of traditional anthropology, these sentiences, often humanoid, act
as the ghost-soul of these inanimate objects and natural features. This places
polytheism as a word that describes helenistic animism. Theos are not much
different than the Devarau of the Nayakans. There is no meaninful distinction
between polytheism and animism other than polytheism is what happens when these
spirits form hierarchies, courts and kingdoms; polytheism concerns the animistic
spirits which rule the cosmos and its functioning.

# Animism
Animism was coined by E.B. Tylor and was the first study in the field of
Anthropology. Tylor invented cultural Anthopology separating it from the study
of Ethnology by inventing the study of Animism.

To Tylor and his brother Alfred, Animism meant "The belief that inside ordinary
visible, tangible bodies there is normally invisible, normally intangible
beings, the soul… each culture [having] its own distinctive animistic beings,
its own specific elaboration of the soul concept."[^first].

::: warning
Animism is **not** the belief in a vital force behind all inanimate things, that is Animatism. Animism is the belief that divine beings live in
inanimate things. Some folkloric beings, like Vampires, are absent this vital
force

## Modernist Animism
Nurit Bird-David, an Israeli professor of anthropology calls these outdated
ideas into question. She explains Tylor's view was created derogatorily to
explain how primitive cultures think like children contrasting it with the
rationality of distinguished scientists calling these beliefs "Savage Thought".
Durkheim writes that Tylor was strongly influenced by the beliefs of children.

::: tip 
Socrates was a rational animist in his polytheism. Since we though of
that 5 minutes into learning about Tylor, we conclude he didn't think too long
about placing these beliefs with the rationality of children.
:::

Since his conclusions were drawn from 2nd hand accounts, we presume he had more
access to analyzing modern children's belief in ghost-souls than he did
indigenous people's animistic beleifs. This is called the Modernist view. In the
modernist view, there is a strict spirit/body or naturalist/supernatural
division as a framework within which the phenomena of Animism are interpreted by
Tylor. This is probably the only view of his that remains as an original tenet
of Animism that wasn't one of his biases.

::: warning
Modernist or Tylorian Animism holds that:
* there exists a thin-unsubstantial human image or ghost-soul that man projects
  onto parts of nature
* these projections allow himself to understand nature by making parallels from
  his own.
* people who percieve these images are dellusional or imagining them
* primitive people cannot distinguish between animate and inanimate things in
  how they emotionally regard them
* humans see nature as human images because they base their worldview on
  themself rather than the world
  * animists imbue all of the world with a nature analogous to his own
:::

In Tylor's view, science was true and animism was delusional. The former
correct, the latter, incorrect. Durkheim painted a more reasonable and less
foolish 'primitive' mind but with the same modernist biases. Durkheim argued
that the primitive self wasn't bisected into the mind and the body, but along
lines dividing between the body and parts of the tribal totem as mind. And this
is where our journey into Celtic paganism truely starts because its the first
correct innovation in the study of a native people and their native place-based
religions.

::: tip
Durkheim's 'tribal totem as mind' is expressed clearly in Celtic
paganism in the phrase 'fire in the head'. This expresses a fire or shining god
as mind among people of arts.
:::

Durkheim wrote that these totems were seen as kin with an entangled fate. He
problematically argued that they mistook the common belief in the totemic force
for a contiguous material body. Claude Levi-Strauss was the first author writing
on the phenomenon deemed 'totemism' in a way that didn't exclude indigenous ways
of knowing, but he tried to divorce the knowledge that comes from totems so he
could reduce the them to symbols. Like Tylor, He also argued that primitive
people strictly divided the world into nature/society.

Guthrie came along after Claude Levi-Strauss and tried to go toward a
survivalist point of view saying that we try to perceive threats and when
perception malfunctions and we wrongly see inanimate objects as the threats
we're looking for. This continues the Modernist view and double downs on how an
animism is a form of biological-psychological error.

::: danger
Modernist animism is propaganda against indigenous people.
:::

Bird-David argues that is a weak position. Animism is the result of wild
uncertainty and panic anxiety in a people extremely learned in local naturalism?
How could that be? The Greeks invented philosophies while simultaneously being
polytheistic, they weren't panicing or anxious about their natural world anymore
than we are and we're further removed from their comfort with Nature. Djinn
believing Arabic Islamists invented algebra, something you can't do in a panic.
Bird-David rightly questions Guthrie's theories by asking what would cause the
maintenance and upkeep of these beliefs. The whole history of Animism is wrought
with racism and diminishing indigenous cognitive ability and the cognitive
ability of anyone living with nature. This is where the state of the art rests,
this is where western academia was near the end of the 20th century.  These
beliefs aren't stupid, they're experiential.

::: tip
Alexei Kondratiev sees same dichotomy as a wild/tribe pair which we
recognize in other pairs like the Adityas/Asuras, Aesir/Vanir,
Olympian/Chthonian, Earthmen(Fir Domnan/Blog)/God-People(Tuatha Dé).

## Actual Animism and Totemism
### Non-human Persons

South Indian Devaru spirits are born of the "affordances" of natural happenings.
This is consistent with how European house-fairies are born. Rites are performed
where participants enter a trance and channel these spirits where they feature
dialogs of "talking, jokes, arguments, singing, sharing, asking for advice or
help." [^third]. Nayakans are in South-India but their spirits are named after a
sanskrit word for god *dev-. In their place, we consider the Celtic gods the
Dewoi or Déithe, from dé(glimmer, smoke, puff), in these contexts for a full
understanding.

::: tip
Sinéad Mattar compares Yeat' fairies with the Nayakan Devaru and
concludes that Nayakan Animism parallels Yeats' persoanl Irish Animism.
:::

Irving Hallowell did fieldwork in Canada among the Ojibwa in the 1930s and wrote
a paper about it in the 1960s. Among the Ojibwa, there is a sense of personhood
that is granted to non-human entities such as animals, rocks, and different
winds. This sense of personhood is vastly different from the ghost-soul
concieved of by modernists.

The modernist view makes personhood solely an attribute of humans and makes the
human and non-human split essential so that non-human can't involve personhood. 

But the Ojibwa see mortal men as a kind of Human person who is but another
creation alongside Wind persons, River persons, and Sky persons.

Personhood becomes an overarching umbrella term given to that which is human and
also to that which is distinctly not-human. Bird-David says, "Hallowell's
alternative 'other-than-human persons' escapes the modernist biases while
adhering to the established human/non-human split".

She uses superpersons, as in persons with extra powers, as the best English
translation. "Spirits" here is not a useful term because it rests on the
modernist dichotomy of spiritual versus material which is inherent to
Christo-Western understanding rather than the ways of knowing used by indigenous
people.

# Animistic Personhood

Strathern compared the Asian Melanesian and Euro-American concepts of personhood
in 1988. She argues that the indivisible nature of the individual in Western
personhood is particularly a new concept and not pervasive.

A person among Melanesians is a sum of all their relationships and as a result,
personhood is a microcosmic mirror of their network within society itself. The
idea of a person is an objectification of one's own relationships embodied as
their personality. Strathern agrees with Dumont that "the Indian is
misrepresented if depicted as an individual, but less because the person has a
holistic-collectivist identity than because, according to Indian ways of
thinking and explaining, each person is a composite of transferable particles
that form his or her personal substance" [^fourth].

In other words, The mind and physical body are made of elements that circulate
within tribe.

I am not a whole representation of my society, because that is yet another
modernist idea of the whole in the individual. Strathern's dividuals seem to be
simply combinations of these circulating parts or totem-parts. Bird-David says,
"When I individuate a human being, I am conscious of her "in herself"; when I
dividuate a person, I am conscious of how she relates with me."

Living in small villages in close proximity the Nayaka had thin walls and
sometimes multiple families to a thatched hut. What one experienced, they all
experienced. One can begin to imagine personhood as the multiple perspectives
orally circulating around the outdoor fire as they culminate into several views
of one shared perspective. In Modernist Western experience, if you hear of
tragedy, you may be afforded the ability to think, "I'm glad this isn't
happening to me." But in more indigenous views of personhood, your entire
village being "one shared space", if tragedy strikes so close you'd know about
it, it is happening to you.

The Nayakans shared everything but distributed it based on entitlements and
status. Therefore precious things were hidden because people could ask for it
since there were no personal possessions among them that didn't belong to
everyone. People leveraged these taboos against one another when one of them
needed to manipulate or embarras the other. In the Carribean and Latin America
this is common practice to give something to someone if they give it a
compliment it, therefore things were kept hidden for the sake of taboo.

Bird-David writes, "this common experience of sharing space, things, and actions
contextualized Nayakans knowledge of each other: they dividuated each other.
They gradually got to know not how each talked but how each talked with fellows,
not how each worked but how each worked with fellows, not how each shared, but
how each shared with fellows, etc."

Western arrogance is our beleif that someone shows us all their facets when we
meet them. Nayakan saw one another not as characters but as "locus of different
rights, duties, titles and kinship names within the clan".

They referred to one another in terms of relation, brother, sister, big uncle,
and even regarded and referred to the anthropologists as kin. Their word for
relatives or kin 'sonta' corresponds to Pintupi 'walytja' and Inuit 'ila', and
probably Xhosa & Zulu 'Ubuntu'. The Nayaka sense of person is more like 'one
with whom we share' and extends to foreigners. Oppose this with Western 'Whole's
set with or against other such wholes' coupled with the idea that we shun
foreigners and exclude them from us-ness. But the animistic personality is
emergent not from some tribal mind, but from the relationships and the events of
the tribe.

Tylor said that Nayaka "think with" this idea of personhood and protected it
resulting in the concept of the devaru. The whole idea of considering a person
merely a 'mental projection' applied to the world is modernist. Instead, saying
that the Nayaka dividuate other beings in their environment, therefore a River
person might look like a collection of all the ways a river treats the other
persons in her locality over time. They become attentive to all those
relationships and to that mind.

Profit to an Animist means an increase in relatedness. A meshing of all the
networks of a place. The noble goals that the society elevate are that they all
work toward this sharing and enmeshment. 

::: tip
We already operate like dividuals in different areas in our lives. For
instance, changing your opinion of a friend when you learn they treat the wait
staff poorly. In Animistic personhood, people know one another as a collection
of their relationships, as a collection of the ways we treat people.
:::

Periodically they invite these non-human superpersons to share with and relate
with and to them. Bird-David calls it a "composite personhood is constitutive of
sharing relationships not only with fellow Nayaka but with members of other
species in the vicinity." They differentiate themselves from these species but
do not dichotomize humans against them. They realize these beings have different
'affordances' and are diverse but that they share the local environment
overrides any differences and creates a new "we-ness", a place-based kind of
kinship. While the human and non-human division exists because it's perceivable,
but Nayaka considered them together as part of the same we-ness rather than
opposites.

Tylor would have them maintaining relationships with other beings because they
needed to project personhood onto them. Instead, they consider hills and wind
persons, because they engage with them, when they engage with them and as they
engage with them. Durkheim would hold that they are deemed persons and therefore
some are considered relatives. Instead, the Nayaka make them relatives by
sharing with them in the locality. Relatives are those with whom you relate(like
the word implies) but through shared experiences. To put this in western terms
for people who still don't understand, personhood is a collection of all your
mental phenomena, most or all of which is shared, sharing observations, food,
activities, interlocks our mental phenomena and therefore our persons.

Their 'spirits' are discovered from affordances(what things objectively and
subjectively are and offer you) that occur during events when a change occurs,
more so when unusually, in the held concepts of their interconnected world. A
Nayakan woman brought a stone to live in the village with her that 'came at her'
while she was digging for roots. A man's relative had a stone 'jump into her
lap' by someone probably admiring it and dropping it, she brought it back to
live with her. Bird-David says, "The particular stones were devaru as they 'came
towards' and 'jumped on' Nayaka. The many other stones in the area were not
devaru but simply stones. Just like one Nayaka man knew an elephant devaru from
regular elephants by it looking him directly in the eye. Ojibwas approach stones
in a similar way: Hallowell recounts how he once asked an old Ojibwa man whether
'all the stones we see about us here are alive'" and he replied, "'No! But some
are'". Alive stones are ones which "move" and "open a mouth" towards Ojibwa.

Detection of spirits, therefore, is by recognizing parts of nature excercizing
their agency. The elephant devaru looked the man in the eye, a story he related
to the others, who now know this devaru as a shared experience when they go out
and observe it. Common affordances become common gods and shared personal
gnosis(SPG) is the true gnosis of Animism.

Animists have a society/nature division but not a body spirit one.

In performances, these devaru are channeled and conversed with informally. They
are asked if they were the cause of disasters as a result of breaking a taboo.
The company that observes these performances judge them based on the quality of
representation. Tim Ingold cites the loss of the authority granted to alternate
ways of knowing among Western civilizations. That modernist epistemology is a
result of their diminishment of importance amid the modern state's political,
economic, and educational institutions. Brian Morris says the body/spirit
division occurred in the 17th century Cartesian metaphysics and bourgeois
liberal theory intrinsic to capitalism. Prior to that, I can imagine we were
just souls comprised of tangible and intangible experiences. Bird-David replies
to the paper's responses saying that these are common traits to hunter-gatherers
but whose elements can be found in other types of societies as well. I believe,
heavily in ones that switch from hunter-gatherer to pastoralist.

### Yeats, The Fairies and the Devaru
These views still express essential dichotomies between Same and Other but do
not label Other as not-Us nor as a "Them". Sinéad Garrigan Mattar says these
redefinitions of animism as human-environmental-relations are consonant with
Yeats collections of fairy lore saying, "Yeats is too easily parodied as an
occultist who dabbled amidst the opportunities that the late nineteenth century
generated for the spiritual disenfranchised Victorian".

Yeats praised scholars who took an "Insider's view" as Bird-David has done with
the Nakaya. Mattar says that Bird-David's work was foreshadowed by Yeats's
scientific practices.

Mattar says, "the 'personhood' of his fairies makes them comparable to the
devaru of Southern India and the Xapiripe of Amazonia". This is significant to
modern understanding of Animism among the people speaking a Celtic language. She
goes on saying, "By the time he wrote The Celtic Twilight, Yeats was "proving"
that in Ireland nature was animated beyond the 'sad soliloquies' of the
materialist British Empire: the subject-object relations of the
nineteenth-century science were defiantly replaced by the subject-subject
experience in the Celtic dawn in these prose anecdotes."

Mattar extracts from Yeats' words, "'The people say that you must no hurt these
bushes and trees because 'the Others' have houses near them; but sometimes it
seems that if you hurt them, you hurt one of 'the Others'...". And she
highlights that Yeats "goes on to tell us that 'souls are sometimes said to be
put into trees for a penance'".

In Yeats worldview, there isn't one distinction between a tree and its soul, or
in the tree's dweller being 'other' as the tree's soul nor in the human souls
inhabiting the tree. This matches every bit of folklore cited in Lecouteax's A
Tradition of Household Spirits.

Mattar calls Yeats' fairies a "part of a complex nexus of social and
supra-social relation, involving, but not simply originate from the cerebral
responses of those human beings." She says, "The fairies as Yeats presents them
are 'dividual' and the thing of the world are part of a locally defined network
of relations between the environment, the human beings who form part of it, and
a spiritual realm that is both separate and intrinsic to this. Fairy spirits as
yeats shows us them, 'operate withing the context of social practices.'"
