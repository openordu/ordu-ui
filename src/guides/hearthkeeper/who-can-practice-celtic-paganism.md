# Who Can Practice Celtic Paganism
## Briefest Intro to the Gods
The proto-celtic word for god is *deiwos, from *deywós for heaven-one/shining-place-one. Their earliest forms were as the Indo-European gods where their first form of worship was a shared meal on days of importance[^first].

Their earliest conception was as a neighboring tribe living in the sky. Medeival conceptions of the Irish gods put them below the ground.

Thus their first role is as cosmic allies of a like allied tribe of neighbors. Each persons experience with different members of a group are different and each person's expereince with the group as a whole is different. Therefore exceptions to simple reciprocity exist. One example is a report by Lucan on Esus, Teutates & Taranis' involving gruesome sacrifices, and that is because the gods are often great and terrible. One certain thing is that tribe of mortals asks the tribe of gods for alliship when we prostrate and bargain with them.

### Terrible Gods Not Toxic Gods

When's the last time someone in a neighborhood approached you and said, "Hey, I choose you to honor me!". It's inappropriate. It's what several of Celtic Pagan left Monotheistic religions to escape. What is appropriate is for a person to come and approach you for a friendship in ways that communicate their friendly intent. There might be an exchange of gifts, tips, tools or invites. I don't think Taranis' gruesome sacrifice practices line up with him wandering around asking 'Do you want to be my worshiper?' Nor does it do any service to envision him as going around demanding you be his follower.

You don't chose your neighbors to honor you, and you don't demand they do. True honor given is always inpsired. You don't go around saying you follow your Dutch neighbor because they called you to do so. I've spent a lot of time growing up in toxic christianities worshiping toxic gods in toxic worldviews. One of the big red flag that a religion is sick is that it's beings are treated as beings that you only propitiate. But we know that for worship with Indo-European gods, our way is through reciprocity[^first]. Non-reciprocal gods give little and take everything, they take your whole identity and make it about them. This is the result of prototyping your deities off of narcicistic parents. The gods are not your mortal mom and dad.

### Reciprocal Gods
We reciprocate with our gods. We come together to a place bordering their world and ask them to join us, as kin, in our magic, to be with us and to share in the give and take of the ritual. We give offerings, and we accept blessings so that we might create a flow.

As such, the Celtic gods, for the most part and with exception, are to be mostly avoided for the Householder & Hearthkeeping ways. You should form a relationship with one if you encounter them, but mostly for now you'll want to stick with whatever gods you have some kind of kinship with. Kinship can come pre-existing like in a family legend. But kinship can also come pre-existing along lines of meaning instead of progeny.

# It's Not a Matter of DNA, It's Not a Matter of Choice

In order to avoid promoting racism, many Celtic pagans these days have defaulted to an attitude that the gods 'choose' whomever are their worshipers. We've discussed this shortly above. Where it was once celebrated to enter into Celtic paganism because of your familial background story, it is considered less noble today.

We think this is a copout, an easy workaround and not a permenant fix. A more studied position already has functions which include and adopt anyone into their kinships of relatedness.

There are serveral views on this among Celtic pagans starting from worst to best:

* White people(specifically of celtic descent) can only practice it — held by hard bigots and racists.
* We should all stay in our own lanes/It is primarily a white person's religion with exceptions — still racist.
* Irish paganism belongs to Irish people only, and regardless of their color. Everyone else should be a follower — Non-racist Ultra-Nationalist
* We are not-diverse enough! We need to increase our POC numbers! We need to de-Eurofy stat! — Often said by well meaning white liberals who want to decorate their space with non-whites to show their woke status
* Anyone can join because the gods choose who they choose to be their servants — better but not true to the study of Celtic paganism
* Ancient pagan animism and indigenous views of animism(ancient and modern) are congruent. The concept of personhood and what a being is include with them milk-kinship, place-based kinship, and affinity-based kinship. — This is the most correct, least racist

## Affinity-kinship

Affinal-kinship is relatedness through marriage. Affinity-kinship is relatedness through something you fancy. A community of D&D Nerds are often diverse but we simultaneously also like witchcraft, folk-horror, and rennesance faires. The people who form close bonds in these kinds of communities will identify the commonality as crucial and even as a matter of celebration. That is to say, people will proudly celebrate the topic as pivotal to their being bonded.

If you are a Black person with no knowledge of having any kind of Celtic background, yet you like all the things I just mentioned along with Celtic Paganism, you are our kin.

This isn't neo-hogwash, cultural-kinship exists in Latin and Meso-American countries, and has ancient precedents in European paganism. It is found in this form in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. That's pretty much everywhere. Hate and exclusion are the neo-hogwash because the world has always been multi-cultural.

Likewise, having an affinity doesn't mean you're phobic of its opposite. There's no such thing as anti-kin so people who have an affinity towards something need not use it to exclude other, start sectarian conflicts, etc.

Also remember that just because someone is kin doesn't mean they are good, safe, trustworthy, or worth having around. Everyone has that one Uncle or Cousin.

### Oghma, An Example

Your name is Jess and you're a poet. Therefore a part of you is also a part of Oghma, and there is a part of him within you.

TLDR: All the people who truely love Dagda are indeed a kind 'related' to him. You're drawn to what resonates. Resonation is an attribute of similarity. Same is the key in "Two things resonating on the same frequency".

## Place-kinship
When researchers visited India and interviewed the 'primative' Nayakans, after a while were regarded as family by them, being called 'Aunt' and 'Uncle'. In that body of research there are Devaru, animistic gods, who have the same function of Ojibwa doodems(totems). That is to say, these Devaru were many tutelary beings who lived in inanimate objects. Some of them were living in the predomenant but important animals of the place.

One can conclude that if you go find a place that Crow watches over, you enter their space and begin to internal evidence you are in their space. Anticipating a thing is that thing acting within you. You see signs of it communicating to you, you feel close to it and a longing to interact with it grows. A bond stregnthens and your dreams are evidence that Crow is inside you. You're inside Crow's kingdom, but Crow is inside you. A place-based kinship is sewn into the family tapestry of all beings. This is a hyper form of ADF's Ghosti [tenet](https://ng.adf.org/article/nine-central-tenets/) where having dealings with people causes you to trade soul parts.

Amergin's song precedents(verb) these idea which we'll discuss in the article on [Animism, Dividualism, the Soul](../animism-dividualism-soul).

There are several ways that everyone interested in practicing this religion becomes kin to a god and their followers. Therefor, through this conception alone will kin vs non-kin can retain its meaningful distinctions, ancient tenets of animism are being honored, and we're not being racist or ultra-nationalist. Also we're not making our gods creepy by making them into psychologicaly unsound beings who collect worshipers while still allowing them to be terrible sometimes.

Bottom line, being here in Celtic pagan space makes you place-kin.

### Example One

Let's say your ancestors came from Nova Scotia where Celtic language has been infused into the place. You can draw kinship from your ancestors to that place as its own Celtic area. You can create a map of provinces based on information in say Rees' Celtic Heritage.

### Example Two

You're a Black person living in Ireland, you have an interest in the study of wloginthe local folklore, it grows on you, youd like to tell Irish tales at the pub and practice Celtic paganism with a few friends who're into it as well. You become Irish by living in Ireland and celebrating Irish things.

TLDR: Being in the shadow of Ben Nevin puts you in the Cailleach's space. The longer you stay there the space seeps into you and she shows up there in your dreams. You're in her and she's in you, you've become place-kin with her and have traded soul parts.

## Milk kin-ship
If you see the Bean Nighe, she is often at a river washing clothes of a person who will die. She beats the cloaths with her breasts slinging them behind her and then again forward to beat the clothes. One of the only ways to survive this encounter once it has already begun is to sneak up behind her and suckle one of her breasts. You become her surrogate-child or her milk child earning you the right to ask whose clothes she's washing and if they are yours to stop washing them.

Language kinship falls under this category.

### Example One

Vyāsa informs Aśvatthāman that because he gained favor of Rudra in a former life, he is now a "son of Rudra" [^second].

::: tip
TLDR: There are folkloric ways to become related to the gods. One primary way is suckling on the niple of the Bean Nighe. Milk-kinship, and other forms of relatedness grant the devotee special abilities with that god. Like asking the Washer-woman whose clothes she is washing, asking her to stop, etc.

[^first]: "The oldest religious rites of Indo-European peoples do not presuppose temples or idols. Nor is there a reconstructible term for 'temple'. But there is a 'worship', conceived as a hospitable reception with a meal, consisting of slaughtered animals, and accompanying recitation of poetry, the 'celestials' coming, as it were, on a visit to the 'earthly ones'."
