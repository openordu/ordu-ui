Abarta (Ábartach, Ábhartach). A minor Fomorian according to Monaghan[^monaghan],
but one of the Tuatha Dé according to Ó hOgáin[^ohogain], and a vampire in later
folklore. In the Finnian cycle when the Fianna were hunting near Cnoc Áine, this
figure posing as an unemployed lazy vassal begged _Fionn Mac Cumhaill_ to become
his servant and join his warband. After agreeing he was given the name _Giolla
Deacair_ meaning 'difficult servant'. He had an ugly and terrifying horse which
he tricked _Conán Maol_ into riding, who then became stuck like when one touches
the mane of a waterhorse. Trying to right the situation 14 other _Fianna_ were
also became stuck and were carried off into The Otherworld. After some
searching, _Fionn Mac Cumhaill_ locates this lazy servant and it is discovered
he is really _Ábhartach mac Ildathaigh_, who was considered to the the world's
most powerful druid. Ábhartach offered to pay Fionn but Fionn forgave the taking
of the fifteen wariors hostage. In later folklore he was described as a blood
sucking [revenant](../r/#revenant) who drinks blood and spends most his time
trapped under a laght(grave monument) in Slaghtaverty. Here he is described as a
dwarf and a magical wizard who was burried upside down by the local cheiftain so
that he wouldn't resurect. However, Ó hOgáin draws from versions where _Fionn
Mac Cumhail_ performs [tenm laida](../t#tenmlaida) and augurs Abarta's one weak
spot, striking him there, burying him and erecting a monument over him.

> on the people he was at last vanquished and slain by a neighbouring chieftain;
> some say by Fionn Mac Cumhail. He was buried in a standing posture, but the
> very next day he appeared in his old haunts, more cruel and vigorous than
> ever. And the chief slew him a second time and buried him as before, but again
> he escaped from the grave, and spread terror through the whole country. The
> chief then consulted a druid, and according to his directions, he slew the
> dwarf a third time, and buried him in the same place, with his head downwards;
> which subdued his magical power, so that he never again appeared on earth. The
> laght raised over the dwarf is still there, and you may hear the legend with
> much detail from the natives of the place, one of whom told it to me.

This dwarven association is probably not one of size but rather one of
relatedness with [wurrums](../w#worms) and thus the Fomorians. It's likely that
this is a banished Bres reprototyped into a half god, half giant who shapeshifts
to decieve and cause trouble among virtuous heros, chaising down old scores from
mythological times among the descenants of Ireland where they once ruled.
