# Noble Attitudes Toward Celtic Paganism

Here, if you worship our Béan Sí and bring in these noble attitudes into your heart, you will domesticate yourself as a hospitable place for Her to live.

Throughout history, speakers of Celtic languages have faced significant oppression by dominant groups. The rich and diverse Celtic heritage, with its distinct languages and traditions, has been marginalized and threatened, as powerful forces have sought to suppress and control these communities. Despite these challenges, the resilient spirit of Celtic peoples has endured, preserving their unique cultural identity.

As we honor and continue the legacy of our Celtic ancestors, we understand the importance of cultivating strong anti-racist attitudes. The struggles faced by our predecessors remind us of the importance of standing up against oppression and discrimination. Our future must be built on inclusivity, understanding, and a shared commitment to dismantling systemic racism.

With this in mind, our order's actions will adhere to our project's goals, and we encourage our members or subgroups to organize anti-racist efforts as part of their own goals and organizations. One of our duties toward these goals is filtering out racism and racist attitudes within our own spaces and separating ourselves from their sources.

By fostering an environment that is safe for diversity, we strive to create spaces that promote inclusivity and let natural processes shape the community. It is crucial to examine any feelings of discomfort and explore them to develop a better understanding of the issues and ourselves.

Therefore, we welcome Irish, Irish-American, and Irish-* individuals from all
backgrounds around the world, and are eager for them to join us and benefit from the shared
experiences. Indigenous religions and practices hold valuable wisdom, and we are
excited about the possibility of diverse spiritual interactions and learning
from one another.

Together, we can honor the rich heritage of Celtic peoples while building a future that champions anti-racism, inclusivity, and respect for all.

## Anti-racist
Being actively anti-racist is crucial. While our order's actions will adhere to our project's goals, we encourage our members or subgroups to organize anti-racist efforts as part of their own goals and organizations. One of our duties toward these goals is filtering out racism and racist attitudes within our own spaces and separating ourselves from their sources.

Fostering an environment that is safe for diversity is essential. We should strive to create spaces that promote inclusivity and let natural processes shape the community. It is crucial to examine any feelings of discomfort and explore them to develop a better understanding of the issues and ourselves.

Therefore, we welcome Irish, Irish-American, and Irish-* individuals from all backgrounds, and are eager for them to join us and benefit from the shared experiences. Indigenous religions and practices hold valuable wisdom, and we are excited about the possibility of diverse spiritual interactions and learning from one another.

We aim to dismantle the notion that Indo-European paganism is synonymous with racism, white people, and the West. This assumption unfairly marginalizes Black and Indigenous Pagans of Color. We are here to welcome them as kin, as part of our community, with all the generosity and hospitality we grant ourselves. Mixed-race individuals are often made to feel like they don't belong; we are here to welcome them as kin, too. Anyone genuinely interested in our beliefs and practices is one of us.

Likewise, we will not change who we are to appeal to those who aren't one of us. We will remain authentic while examining and addressing our latent assumptions about race and privilege. If we can connect with a wider audience beyond those who identify as white, our goals are being met.

Pagan groups should focus on addressing the real concerns of existing pagans from diverse backgrounds rather than opting for superficial changes in symbols and programming. Giving these individuals a genuine voice and considering their perspectives is essential for fostering a truly inclusive and respectful environment.

## Anti-fascist


We believe in the importance of understanding and defining fascism through a thorough examination of its ideology. We highlight that fascism does not celebrate pluralism and often creates a dichotomy between the state and its perceived enemies. We emphasize that, among those who are tolerant of pluralism, there is a diverse array of attributes, both hidden and apparent. These attributes may connect people, but they don't necessarily need to separate or divide them. By promoting rigorous logic and thoughtful action, a wise organization can foster unity and inclusivity while resisting the divisive nature of ideologies like fascism.

## Nationalism vs Ultra-nationalism
Nationalism we define as having a special identity and we view that as coming
 with a special duty and relationship with those who share in that identity.

Ultranationalism, a core element of fascism, we define as having a sense of
 exclusive or purist identity and viewing that as coming with an exclusive duty
 and relationship only with those who share in it.

Nationalism is how both America and Ireland won Independence. Black Nationalism
 exists to uphold the cultural uniqueness of Black people. The noble
 Black-Panthers were Black Nationalists. The Ó Déisí clan are certainly a
 Psycho-ethnicity which is a kind of nationalism per our definition. Those who
 feel they belong to this new clan we're creating do belong to it, and they do
 have a special duty to those others who share in this belonging.

This project, culture, and clan has zero room or tolerance to for
 ultra-nationalism, purism or exclusivity.

## Celtophilia / Celtophobia
Celtophilia is having too much love for the Celts and is expressed in constantly
 granting them a generosity in conception and cognition which they don't
 actually deserve. Cultures have an entropic baseline for doing things. If your
 measure of one doesn't fall along lines of regular entropy, for example, if you
 think your culture or people are more special than anyone else, but its a
 feeling and not a logical argument, you're probably a Celtophile. Celtophiles
 can exist at all levels of study. Peter Beresford Ellis, for instance, can
 barely conceive of human sacrifice among the druids, though it is very highly
 likely that it simply was a part of regular Celtic life to see a person
 sacrificed. Throughout his book "A brief history of the Druids", he grants them
 a reprieve at every turn. The Celts being awesome at every turn is
 entropically imbalanced, aka too good to be true, and therefore you can bet
 that scenario is false.

Celtophobia is a reluctance to use the term Celtic, a reluctance to see Celtic
 languages as related, or the tendency to get upset when Celtic commonalities are
 highlighted. Fear that your favorite Celtic culture will be seen as less unique
 or the same as another are insecurities. Your fear or arguments will not change
 the trajectories for which these cultures are already on course. Nobody worth
 interacting with in the study of Celtic cultures thinks those cultures as the
 same. Highlighting their commonalities and calling them Celtic doesn't
 eliminate the real distinctions between these cultures, therefore they don't
 need defending. 

Both of these ways of being are traps, they both over-romanticize one part,
level, layer, or order of magnitude. Try to avoid them.

## Anti-credulity
We value critical thinking. We monitor ourselves for flights of fancy. We are
 aware when our inner selves simply want to desire something to be true, and we
 know what it looks like when our inner selves select data that agrees with us.
 We fight against those tendencies. We know when we are explaining a phenomenon
 with the least simple explanation. And we know that a lack of an explanation for
 something isn't an invitation to invent our favorite explanation.

Skepticism and doubt are our closest friend. If you are here because you think
 you're the next King Arthur, you won't like it here, you'll feel made fun of and
 relegated to the side. We will constantly try to disprove extraordinary claims.
 The same goes for eager believers. We'd rather be populated by people under a
 crisis of faith than by those who've never had one.

## You May Not Belong
There are areas where you don't belong. If you identify as a man, you do not get
 to complain about being excluded from a priestesshood, I don't care how awesome
 they are. If you are an Irish-American person, you don't get to insert yourself
 into conversations about things that don't concern you, especially to invalidate
 the concern of lived experience of a person who is welcome in such a
 conversation.

If people are having a discussion about Co Clare customs and you are not from Co
 Clare and have limited to no information about Co Clare customs, your place of
 belonging is as an asker of questions and a listener. Many conversations on
 culture and identity are derailed by those who are not of said identity, against
 said identity, are peripheral to said identity, or are of said identity who have
 ideologically turned against those within that identity.

In any of these cases, those that care about a thing, live with a thing, share a
 sense of belonging to and with a thing. Those are the folks core to a
 conversation, and who they feel are valuable to include are valuable to
 include.

## Regarding people speaking Celtic languages
Some people speak Celtic languages still. These are extremely insular people who
 if they are harmed by druidry, druidism, neopaganism or the practice of Celtic
 paganism, our respectful practice cannot do them any more harm than they've
 already experienced from both insiders and outsiders.

Leading into the next topic, those who speak a Celtic language have a unique way
 of seeing the world if soft Sapir-Whorfism is true. Our ancestors worldview
 would be as different from current Celtic language speakers as ours is from
 those same speakers. Therefore it is not very likely that anyone will have a
 linguistic worldview similar enough to that held by pagans to matter. Therefore,
 anyone living is as privileged and able as is needed to create and use Celtic
 Pagan worldviews.

However, speakers of Celtic languages are indeed closer to that pagan worldview
 than speakers of any other languages. We can look to them as special persons
 from which we can learn as much as we can. We can contribute the fruits of that
 labor and learning here. Being from a Celtic country and being a speaker of a
 Celtic language, while gives you special popularity, honor, social currency,
 etc... it doesn't automatically make you a good person or a person people want
 to have around, so I wouldn't simply trust a person's behavior, honesty,
 information fidelity based on their language or point of origin.

## Pro Soft Sapir-Whorfism

Sapir-Whorfism is a hypothesis that states your language limits or propels your
 thoughts, and your thoughts limit your worldview, so that speakers of different
 languages have different worldviews. Hard Sapir-Whorfism(which has been
 disproven) states that some thoughts of a person cannot be understood by those
 of a different language. This is called Linguistic Determinism.

Linguistic Relativity, however, is the soft Sapir-Whorfian hypothesis which
 states that languages affect our automatic reality and automatic perception. A
 speakers language affects their worldview.

Examples of this are the perception of time by people who do not have words for
 time, or people's more detailed perception of snow because they have more words
 for kinds of snow. Piraha people only have three counting words: one, two,
 many. As a result, they've proven in studies to be unable to tell the
 difference between four and five accurately on a regular basis.

In this way, Celtic languages who share elements and commonalities with one
 another creates within people a worldview uniquely Celtic that varies from
 language to language. This means we can't have anything to do with a Celtic
 worldview unless we learn some Celtic words and their meaning, potentially how
 to use such words and stringing them together to create or understand a
 communication from another person who also can do this.

One way we know Linguistic Determinism to be false, Ildefonso in 1991 was taught
 sign language for the first time at age 27. He told of past events, which means
 language didn't determine his thoughts as he had no language. Poets like Pablo
 Neruda feel like translations of their works convey the same meaning.

Thought exists before language. Instead of linguistic determinism, we prefer to
 believe that people of differing languages think about and perceive the world
 differently. We discriminate along lexical categorizations.

## Pro Diaspora
Anti-Diaspora attitudes run strong within Jewish Zionist communities. Purists
 are disgusted with their diasporans calling them disfigured, poor, disoriented,
 despised, lacking taste, feeling inferior while also feeling a part of the
 chosen people.

We have a word for not wanting your pure culture or pure race to mix with the
 people of the world, its called racism, and we are anti-racist, so therefore we
 are pro-diaspora where it isn't a forced colonization. If Irish people mix with
 the world, people of some or only Irish descent and people who were mixed with,
 would all benefit from it.

It is a romantic and not a real ideal to return to or keep to any kind of "pure"
 or "authentic" Celtic or Irish connections. It is a hard fact that the cultural
 practices that could be called pagan were often dwindling when committed to page
 before the nineteenth century. Modern people in Ireland with access to these
 customs are *demonstrably* as disconnected from these customs as some
 Irish-American asshole in California.

## Pan-Celtic Practices
There were and are no such thing as Pan-Celtic practices. There may have been a
 Pan-Celtic druid order but such an order in the Iron Age would have no doubt
 been a congress of Celtic Culture and not a Pan-Celtic culture generator.

If you take any selection of books on Celtic customs and apply them to Celtic
 worldviews, you are creating a remix. Your family sharing Celtic customs with
 you, knowing too many to share and forgetting some are creating a remix by
 sharing with you. Each generation in a culture is a remix of the elements that
 are circulating within it.

The only thing you can create is a remix, its how the mind works. So all that
 exists are a whole bunch of slightly unique remixes. In that view, pan-Celtic
 anything cannot exist, there is no such thing. Pan-Irish anything cannot exist,
 there is no such thing as Irish Paganism. Instead, the place where you are,
 there's that kind of paganism through a linguistic and cultural lense.

Now that you don't need to worry about if things that do not exist are a problem
 for you or not, you can just ignore arguments about Pan-Celticism for or
 against, because such arguments are all m00t. Even if I thought it could exist,
 and were I to try to practice a Pan-Celtic religion, I'd just end up practicing
 a remixed Texas-Anglo-Erse syncretism, which would be a local phenomenon and not
 a Pan phenomenon. The moment you practice a thing you localize it, and so no Pan
 practices exist, only localized ones.

## Works Without Faith
You can do the rites but they aren't empowered unless you have the teachings.
 It's that simple. Your participation in the gifting cycle will best succeed when
 you know what it is. Therefore you can do gifting cycle rites, but if you don't
 know why or what for, you're not actually doing gifting cycle rites.

## Methodologies and Time Scales
We define the reconstructionist methodology as any method that seeks to arrive
 at modern practices as they would have been given to us without interruptions
 and adheres to the guidelines in the CRFAQ.

We define the post-reconstructionist methodology as any method that builds upon
 the reconstructionist methodology, yet, will invent anything, fill
 any hole, be inspired any kind of way needed to arrive at a whole-cloth
 practice. Reconstructionists will not take shortcuts, but post-recons will, but
 only in a recon way.

Post-recon methods build upon recon ones, so using it doesn't mean you'll
 invent practices willy-nilly, without the sciences of anthropology, archeology,
 linguistics, mythology, folklore, and contiguous arguments.

A common post-recon move is to take the precedence of one thing, for example,
 Ogham's use in magical sigils might make someone think it could be used for
 divination. Many recons are really post-recons.

Sure we've mischaracterized some with these definitions, however, people still
 think reconstructionists are re-enactors, so our sins here are small compared to
 the intentional misunderstanding the pagan community gives the reconstructionist
 communities. We've also lost the battle trying to get people to understand that
 recons are not re-enactors of Iron aged religion, so we need to shift to new
 terms.

The core ideas in paganisms of Indo-European cultures are set in stone, are
 thousands of years old, and do not change because time has knocked them around
 into their final equilibrium. We don't need to invent practices where there are
 no holes. Religions created on short time scales are simply not at all as good
 as older ones in this case because they have been tested for less time.

Often people shun study because it's too hard, but this is the appropriate
 difficulty level of a clergy person.

## Acculturation
The process of acculturating to these praxes and rites, ways of being and
 operating, is strictly and primarily done through the reading and following of
 these texts, and through mentorship by someone ordained as a priest of these
 texts. These texts are the arbiter of this religion and culture. This project
 and these texts, I feel are divinely inspired by my work with the Cailleach of
 Cahercalla, who, I think inspires different approaches within different people
 who work with her.

This may not go anywhere, nor might it become popular... if it simply serves as
 a basis for a small group of followers of this cult-worship, it has well served
 a purpose. These texts belong to those who immerse and steep themselves within
 them. If you love these texts, you cannot be denied a belonging to them. The texts
 should be guided by the average opinion of those belonging to it. "Average
 opinion" here simply means the calculated middle of all extremes divided by the
 number of extremes. The wisdom of the crowd provides error correction that the
 visionaries cannot see, just as the visionaries in a group provide a path
 forward that the crowd cannot yet see.

The means of acculturation is immersion in this lore and its people. This lore
 provides almost nothing for those interested in autocratic pride in separation
 from the tribe. Solo practitioners among us are just our people disconnected
 from one of our locus of culture. Anti-social or people-hostile solo
 practitioners by choice have no belonging to this group.
   
   note: "Is a spiritual vacuum that this society we live in, it creates
   people that are looking for something that is real. - Dennis

## Appropriation
A group of people taking a heritage they have access and rights to, tracking it
 with perfect diligence, defining the praxes and precedents of it, and making it
 available for acculturation, help reduce appropriation. It doesn't just
 pay it lip-service by a technical and legal loopholes, open-sourcing a culture,
 like open-sourcing software, eliminates the number of imitators because they can
 just get the real detailed information.

In our modern world, especially in North America, we are in a culture which
 produces people who are longing and yearning for connection to something deeply
 rooted. If you don't give them good information, they will imitate what they see
 and fill in the holes.

It's bigger than simply the idea that indigenous people have nicer ceremonies
 and we want them too. Often I see reconstructions looking like American-Indian
 lookalikes, replacing warpaint with runes and headdresses with leather dangles.

A great number of American-Indians perform ceremony in suits or jeans because
 materialism is a western ideal. The clothes making the man is not a tenant of
 cultures which are dwelling in the same place as the homeland of their language.

Therefore, acculturation to something new and complex involves changing
 fundamental ideas at the root of your worldview like clothes making the man. We
 cannot control, nor do we wish to control, what other people do with this
 repository. What we can do is place restrictions on closing these texts, make
 sure the texts contain valuable and accurate information, and promote a certain
 set of attitudes that when held creates a sacred and respectable Celtic
 Paganism within most people.

## Picking and Choosing
Compile your religion from the menu of what's available here. A university
 offers all majors though a student specializes in one or more. Eventually the
 goal will be that there'll be so much here you would run yourself ragged trying
 to upkeep every praxes. Such choices allows each person and household to have a
 set of unique practices that they've compiled from a source of instructions.
 `Include` whatever part of these practices you need to accomplish your subgroup
 or family's goals.

People who take these texts, pick and choose them, toward goals that do not fall
 along these attitudes expressed in this project, though they are licensed to do
 so, will be considered poor imitators. The difference between serious cosplay vs
 kids in Wallmart costumes, or a Ferarri vs a child's bicycle, represents the the
 vast difference between recon and post-recon Druids vs 'Celtic Shamans'.

## Emulation Instead of Imitation
While emulation is defined by imitation, it is much more than poor imitation.

Emulation is an form of imitation that takes seriously all of a system or
 processes inputs and outputs and tries to arrange them correctly until it
 functions in an identical way to the original form.

Playstation consoles, for instance, operate on code that people cannot see.

However, people create their own code to handle the inputs and outputs so that
 the game will run, sometimes poorly. Poorly emulated games just need more time
 to develop. A key point of emulation is that you know how something is supposed
 to function though you cannot see the processes which make it do so.

There is currently no form of Celtic paganism that isn't emulated or imitated
 since the original is long gone and since the contents of the original is up to
 speculation. However, Academic pursuits equip us with a lot of tools to
 illuminate the likely options, which we can, like emulators, try and see if the
 experiences described by people, i.e. some passages in the Vedas are what one
 experiences when they try to recreate entheogenic Soma.

People emulating Celtic Paganism sometimes claim to be more authentic than
 others, but such claims are basically made for internet keywords because that
 what people expect and search for. Sure people are better than others at
 emulating what might have happened in the iron age, and some people are better
 at being clergy today. Which is more important?
 
Additionally, authority vocalization and language is the number one factor people
 use to judge authority. So its enticing to cast a circle of validity and lord
 over it. But this can't be done by people with a serious and intelligent mind
 who place authenticity within the realms of intellectual honesty.

The fact that there are no practicer of original Celtic paganism, it puts
 everyone on the same footing and labels everyone an emulator.
