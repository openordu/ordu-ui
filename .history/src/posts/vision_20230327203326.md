## Project Mission
Mission Statement of OpenOrdú

### I. Purpose

The primary purpose of OpenOrdú is to establish and maintain a digital platform dedicated to the exploration, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge pertaining to Celtic Paganism, Celtic Reconstructionism, Celtic Post-reconstructionism, and Neodruidism.

### II. Open-Source Principles

OpenOrdú shall operate in accordance with the principles of open-source software, encouraging users to access, create, and share resources freely. This includes, but is not limited to, common works, records of discourse, canonical texts, translations, and metadata.

### III. Licensing

OpenOrdú shall employ a licensing model that allows for the unrestricted use, modification, and distribution of content, subject to proper attribution and adherence to established licensing agreements. The organization shall follow the precedents set by software licensing to ensure the integrity and accessibility of its content.

### IV. User Engagement and Collaboration

OpenOrdú shall provide a platform for user-generated content, fostering an environment that encourages collaboration, contribution, and the exchange of ideas. This shall be achieved through a system that facilitates content review, modification, and integration into the main body of knowledge.

### V. Quality Assurance and Content Management

OpenOrdú shall maintain a commitment to ensuring the quality and accuracy of its content by implementing a system for content review and approval. This system shall involve a tiered approach to user contributions, ensuring that only high-quality, relevant, and accurate content is integrated into the main repository.

### VI. Preservation of Knowledge and Adaptability

OpenOrdú shall serve as a reliable and enduring source of knowledge, adaptable to changes in the field of study and resilient to the rise and fall of organizations or institutions. By maintaining a decentralized and flexible repository, OpenOrdú aims to guarantee the longevity and accessibility of the shared knowledge for future generations.

### VII. Ó Déisí Clan Society and Worldwide Subgroup Affiliations (Revised)

In addition to serving as a digital platform for the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, OpenOrdú shall also function as a clan society, known as the Ó Déisí Clan Society. Members of the Ó Déisí Clan Society will be considered as having a bond akin to legal kinship or milk-kinship with the Bean Sí, fostering a sense of community and shared identity among its members.

The Ó Déisí Clan Society shall facilitate the establishment and affiliation of worldwide subgroups, referred to as Septs. These Septs will serve as local communities or churches that practice the religion supported by OpenOrdú, promoting the values and principles of the platform within their respective localities.

The Septs shall operate in accordance with the mission and bylaws of OpenOrdú, while also maintaining the autonomy to adapt their practices to suit the needs and preferences of their local communities. Septs are encouraged to form their own organizations in their local regions, independent of OpenOrdú's IRS affiliations. Reporting to OpenOrdú is not required for a Sept to remain active, allowing for greater flexibility and autonomy in their operations.

By fostering a global network of interconnected Septs, the Ó Déisí Clan Society aims to cultivate a sense of unity and belonging among its members, while simultaneously promoting the growth and development of the religion and practices supported by OpenOrdú.


## Open-Source religion has a few contexts:
* Religious software like [Open
 Siddir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Siddur_Project)
* Repositories of common works, records of discourse, and important texts like
   [Witchcraft Information Centre and
   Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20180422043802/http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php)
  * Regarded as the first open-source paganism, founded in 1999 as a research
   and education provider specialising in the areas of Witchcraft, Wicca,
   Paganism, Magic
  * This is the contexts that [celticpaganism.org](celticpaganism.org) operates
    within.

The contents of this website will exist for the free use of anyone with
 attribution under a license we will create and maintain.


## Project Vision
In a world faced with mounting challenges such as climate change-driven mass migrations, rising sea levels, and a rapidly evolving digital economy, paganism serves as a vital coping mechanism for many. As humanity ventures forth into space, explores the realms of the gods, or seeks refuge in underground seed arks, this project aims to remain relevant and accessible across time and space.

Designed to be easily stored, shared, and distributed on small drives, this text will accompany humanity wherever it goes. By translating it into numerous languages and archiving it in countless data centers, future generations will be able to access and benefit from it.

Reconstructionist and post-Recon Paganism must evolve beyond the limitations of worn and fading out-of-print books. To preserve the valuable knowledge and insights gained through countless discussions and debates, a centralized platform for storing this information is essential.

While we have yet to establish institutions resembling Druid Colleges or develop robust oral traditions, our text-based culture demands a new approach. This project serves as a menu of customs, rites, songs, prose, poetry, and more, inviting contributions from all who share the vision.

Our goal is to create a community-driven resource guide on par with Mary Jones' website, embracing the concept of open-source religion through a git project. Accessible to anyone, this platform allows users to make changes and engage in discussions, ensuring a continuous evolution of ideas.

By implementing a sensible system of contributor tenuring and tiered approvals, we can maintain the integrity of the project while welcoming diverse perspectives. As a devotional act inspired by agreements with the gods, this project aspires to be an academic-quality publication that encourages practice, transcending organizational boundaries and serving as a foundation for countless guides and resources.





## Isn't that what Wikipedia is?
The gatekeepers of information on Wikipedia frequently revert changes made by well-respected scholars in the field of Celtic Paganism for various unjustifiable reasons. While the concept of Wikipedia is commendable and unparalleled, the current Wiki-Lords impede genuine contributions. As highly skilled specialists with extensively debated arguments in the most discerning pagan communities, we have a responsibility to articulate these ideas and develop guides to navigate the intricate landscape of knowledge.

## Moving Away from Institutions as Lore-Repositories
We aim to create a website that functions similarly to ADF's public and member site for its users, while maintaining a non-denominational approach like maryjones.us for Celtic Reconstructionists.

This approach addresses several issues:

1. Interaction with this comprehensive repository demands no financial contribution or allegiance to a central organization.
1. Lore can preserve organizations, rather than organizations preserving lore.
1. The ebb and flow of organizations have no impact on this code, as it is not owned but self-licensed.
1. If an organization ceases to exist, even the one maintaining this particular version of lore, the lore can be retrieved from the archive and incorporated into a new site.
1. Our agility is comparable to a song on a spear, rather than being as slow as an oak tree.
1. Necessary updates can be implemented swiftly when new information emerges.
1. A git repository meticulously records the complete history of the evolution of lore, even through countless changes. This allows people to examine trends in the ideas of lore maintainers and safeguard against religious revisionism. Defacing every iteration of every change in a git repository becomes difficult as long as the repository persists.

## What more can we do than Wikipedia ever could
Stakeholders can be approvers of content. The more approvers there are, the more
 diverse and representative of wild nature our ideas will be. Wikipedia is ruled
 by information Barons often leaning too hard on tenuous ideas and not enough on
 solid ones.

With [Basic](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/),
[Extended](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/), and [Theme Specific
 Markdown](/docs/editing/) we have more features than Wikipedia.

Wikipedia isn't organized to collect customs, traditions, rites, or songs toward
 promoting the practice of paganism.

Licensing religious works addresses these issues:

1. Preservation and accessibility of knowledge: Ensuring that valuable information about Celtic Paganism, Celtic Reconstructionism, Celtic Post-reconstructionism, and Neodruidism is preserved, maintained, and easily accessible for future generations.
1. Adaptability and resilience of the community: Addressing the challenges faced by humanity, such as climate change, mass migrations, and a changing digital economy, by creating a flexible, adaptable, and easily distributable repository of knowledge and practices that can be carried forward and utilized in various contexts.
1. Lack of sustainable institutions: Recognizing the difficulty in establishing long-lasting institutions like Druid Colleges or oral traditions in the modern world, and providing an alternative solution through a text-based platform that aligns with the contemporary culture.
1. Encouraging collaboration and contribution: Creating an open-source, community-driven platform that allows individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise to contribute to the development and evolution of the knowledge base, while maintaining quality standards and preventing the infiltration of undesirable elements.
1. Addressing limitations of existing platforms: Overcoming the challenges faced by platforms like Wikipedia, where contributions by experts in the field may be stifled or reverted, by creating a dedicated space for highly trained specialists to share their knowledge and insights.
1. Decentralization and independence from organizations: Ensuring that the repository is not tied to any specific organization or denomination, allowing the lore to be maintained and utilized independently of the rise or fall of individual institutions.
1. Transparency and accountability: Utilizing a git repository system to maintain a comprehensive history of changes and contributions, allowing for transparency and protection against religious revisionism.

### Subgroups
ADF has an overkill on subgroups. We're going have cultural subgroups called
kinships and role subgroups called colleges.

The cultural subgroups will be:
* Irish
* Scottish
* Welsh
* Manx
* Gaulish
* Bretton
* A Syncratic culture involving at least one of the above.
* Any specific ethnoliguistic group that I've forgoten.

The role subgroups will be:
* Druids
* Seers
* Bards
* Cunning Folk
* Layfolk

Each subgroup will seek to maintain their own guide in the [guides](/guides)
 section. They will strive to make it complete and comprehensive, well formatted
 and well organized.

::: warning Contributors We have need for these types of contributors at the
beginning stages:
1. Researchers
2. Writers
3. Proof readers :::
